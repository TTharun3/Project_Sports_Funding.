This time last year last year on Elba,  we happened to stay in a resort that is home to a tennis camp run by the legendary Italian coach, Riccardo_Piatti. Piatti has coached the likes of Novak Djokovic, Ivan Ljubičić, Richard Gasquet, and is now part of Milos Raonic's camp.
Jake looked on in envy as some of Italy's top juniors trained for six hours a day,  followed by friendly matches under the floodlights. I told Jake that if he started to take his tennis seriously, he too could perhaps take part in the Piatti camp one day.
Jake's worked hard on his tennis this past year, winning all his under 12 club matches, and winning first round singles in three tournaments already this summer. When we arrived here a week ago Jake was booked in for two hours a day normal coaching, however when Jake swaggered up in all his kit, they asked if he would like to join the Piatti training camp.
Jake literally got on his knees and begged us, Dani and I relented, and ten minutes later Jake was having his ground strokes taken apart by Piatti, who had welcomed him into his fold.
Below is a link to a little video Jake made to show where he has got to after a week of 6 hours training a day.
It was quite a serious financial commitment to make on the make the first week possible, and now he is begging us again to take part in week two of the camp.  
I said I would ask some family and friends on his behalf, if they were willing to support Jake at what he believes is the outset of his young tennis career. Where he will take it from here has yet to be seen, but Piatti said it's rare for an eleven year old to jump five inches off the ground on his first serve !
The cost of week two is just over EUR 1000, which will now try to raise over the next couple of days.
They'll be no immediate return on your investment, however all kind sponsors will be kept informed of Jake's progress from here on in.  And who knows, it might mean one day mean that you're sitting at the back of the players box at SW19 !

In 2016 I got recruitet for the Iranian national team and a dream comes true. Playing for my country I was born. I've been to Iran after 34 years! I met my team mates, coaches, friends and family and specially my country after such a long time. We started to practice together, go out together and I found a second family. I've started to run donations in Switzerland to help the Iranian national team to attend as the first Ice Hockey team of Iran at the Asian Winter Games in Sapporo, Japan 2017, me as the 1st Captain.
We attend at the Asian Roller Skating Championship and won the gold medal in Inlinehockey, what an unbelievable story.
and no we really want to reach new level of dreams at the World Roller Games in Barcelona. But due to the whole embargo of our country my team mates has no possibility of getting sponsors or help from other people.

Hi!
We're Defenders Wrocław(https://www.facebook.com/defenders.wroclaw/), we playing Korfball(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korfball) from season 2014/15. In last two seasons we've got 4th place in Polish Korfball League. From that season we will play in two leagues at the same time! Polish and Czech! In our team plays actual and ex players from Polish National Team. We have young promising players and we have lot of willingness to train and play in Poland and around the World!
but...(always is a ""but"")
...a few days ago we lost possibility to train for free(as before) in our sports hall, with no true reasons(other teams can do it). That hall is one of two full-size sports hall in Wrocław with stuff to play Korfball. The second don't have a free term, so we can't rent that. Even if we can, we can't because... we don't have enough money.
Korfball isn't popular in Poland(unfortunately), so we don't have a sponsors, founders or donors. We 'live' just from our contributions and sometimes small donors from friends.

Now we have a few problems:
1. We don't have a place to train
2. We don't have Korfball Stuff(baskets and balls) to train
3. We don't have a place to play matches
4. We don't have enough money to rent a sports hall with Korfball stuff, or buy Korfball Stuff and rent another sports hall

It's our first time when we need to ask you for some help. For us every cent is important, so amount of your donate doesn't matter. 
Every help is very, very important!

We really want to play, but without your help we can't do it...
We will be extremely grateful for any kind of help!

Cześć!

Z tej strony Defenders Wrocław(https://www.facebook.com/defenders.wroclaw/), gramy w Korfball(https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korfball) od sezonu 2014/15. Od tego sezonu będziemy grali w dwóch ligach na raz - Polskiej i Czeskiej! W naszym klubie grają aktualni oraz byli reprezentanci Polski. W większości tworzą nas młodzi, obiecujący gracze, którzy mają dużo chęci do treningów i gry zarówno w Polsce jak i poza granicami naszego kraju.

Niestety ta hala jest jedną z dwóch pełnowymiarowych hal we Wrocławiu, które posiadają sprzęt do Korfballu. Ta druga nie ma niestety wolnych terminów, więc nie mamy możliwości jej zmiany. Nawet gdyby terminy były, to i tak niewiele by nam to dało, ponieważ w tym momencie na taki wynajem nas nie stać...
Korfball niestety nie jest w Polsce popularnym sportem, więc nie mamy stałych sponsorów, darczyńców itd. Utrzymujemy się wyłącznie z własnych składek członkowskich i czasami jakiś drobnych środków od znajomych, bądź ich firm.

W tym momencie mamy kilka problemów:
1. Nie mamy gdzie trenować
2. Nie mamy sprzętu do Korfballu
3. Nie mamy miejsca do grania meczy(a raczej pieniędzy na jego wynajem)
4. Nie mamy wystarczających środków, żeby wynająć halę ze sprzętem do Korfballu, lub kupić taki sprzęt i wynająć inną halę.

To nas pierwszy raz, gdy musimy prosić o pomoc. Każdy grosz w tym momencie jest dla nas niesamowicie cenny, więc wysokość wsparcia nie ma znaczenia. Każda pomoc jest nam bardzo, bardzo potrzebna!

Bardzo chcemy nadal grać i odnosić sukcesy, ale bez Waszej pomocy chyba nie będzie to możliwe...

SUPPORTERS",Cross Country Skiing,my athletic goal is +when i was 14 i decided that i wanted to pursue skiing at a level that would get me to the olympics  after nearly 10 years of training and competing with this goal in mind i almost achieved my goal  at the olympic trials races this past winter  i won the first of two sprint races  the winner of the second sprint was selected for the olympic team and i was the only eligible alternate for the last sprint team spot  my training and planning for this race season have been strongly influenced by this result and from this glimpse of my potential i have a lot of confidence for what i can achieve this year ++to be a member of a national development centre like the one i train with in thunder bay  ontario  requires a fee of  12 500  this fee covers all our training camps during the summer as well as all the north american racing trips through the winter  my goals for this year include qualifying for some world cup tour trips where i will need to pay for the travel to europe for several weeks of racing  this will require a higher budget than i have planned for the past few years ++my first few years on a training centre i worked part time at a furniture store doing deliveries  thanks to the support of stonewaters sponsoring me from the sales of what was nicknamed  the bob couch  and very flexible scheduling for my hours  i was able to nearly fully support myself  there was still a cost to my training and i had to make compromises that lead to a fall in my expected performance progression  the past 2 years my parents have been my support and i can't thank them enough for standing behind me and believing in me as much as they do  this is a big stress on my family and i am trying to reach out to my amazing community of friends who have always shown interest in my skiing pursuits ++to be able to train without the stress of not knowing whether i can cover the expense of all the races i hope to attend and

When I was 14 I decided that I wanted to pursue skiing at a level that would get me to the Olympics. After nearly 10 years of training and competing with this goal in mind I almost achieved my goal. At the Olympic Trials races this past winter, I won the first of two sprint races. The winner of the second sprint was selected for the Olympic team and I was the only eligible alternate for the last sprint team spot. My training and planning for this race season have been strongly influenced by this result and from this glimpse of my potential I have a lot of confidence for what I can achieve this year.

To be a member of a National Development Centre like the one I train with in Thunder Bay, Ontario, requires a fee of $12 500. This fee covers all our training camps during the summer as well as all the North American racing trips through the winter. My goals for this year include qualifying for some World Cup Tour trips where I will need to pay for the travel to Europe for several weeks of racing. This will require a higher budget than I have planned for the past few years.

My first few years on a Training Centre I worked part time at a furniture store doing deliveries. Thanks to the support of Stonewaters sponsoring me from the sales of what was nicknamed ""The Bob Couch"" and very flexible scheduling for my hours, I was able to nearly fully support myself. There was still a cost to my training and I had to make compromises that lead to a fall in my expected performance progression. The past 2 years my parents have been my support and I can't thank them enough for standing behind me and believing in me as much as they do. This is a big stress on my family and I am trying to reach out to my amazing community of friends who have always shown interest in my skiing pursuits.

To be able to train without the stress of not knowing whether I can cover the expense of all the races I hope to attend and qualify for is an enormous benefit. It is the difference between wondering, ""Can I go on that trip if I qualify for it"", to ""I'm going on that trip, when I qualify for it"". The mental state makes a huge difference on performance, and money worries can be a large stress on anyone.
I will be using the funds for:
The expenses that make up my National Development Centre fee for this year are:

Equipment - $2 000

Summer Camps
Altitude and Volume Camp - Bend, Oregon - $1 200
Volume Camp - Hayward, Wisconsin - $800

Early Season Snow Camp - Canmore, Alberta - $1 500
December North American Cup Races - Montana and B.C. - $3 000
January North American Cup Races - Ontario - $1 500
Finland Polar Cup Tour - $2500

I hope to break onto the International racing scene this year, the estimated costs of those trips are:

January World Cup Tour #2 - Otepaa, Estonia + Rybinsk, Russia - $4 000
February Scandinavian Cup B-Tour - Lahtvia + Estonia - $4 000

Covering my domestic expenses will make planning and preparing for the cost of an international trip much more manageable and achievable.
Your contribution means:
I can continue to race with all my focus on getting to the top of the podium. Cross Country skiing is a long term sport, with the majority of racers not hitting the peak of their careers until their late 20's. Getting support while still being a developing athlete will help me to get to that next level and put me solidly on track for the World Cup and Olympic starts I dream about.

Any amount of support I can get is greatly appreciated and I want to thank everyone for believing in me so far. I hope that in sharing my experiences, both the highs and lows, I can inspire new generations of competitors.",9.0,4.0,10.0,24.0,1.0,20.0

Heading into this upcoming season we are currently ranked within the top 15 on the Canadian Team Ranking System (CTRS) list, and ranked among the top 25 men's curling teams in the World. We hope to continue this success and to keep climbing up the rankings!


Team Gunnlaugson is made up of four members: Jason, Colton, Kyle and Rob who are all extremely dedicated to the sport of curling. Dedication is a major factor in becoming an elite team, and we feel that we are on the right track to getting there. We have set out a number of goals for this upcoming season, with our main goal being qualifying for the 2017 Olympic Pre-Trials. In order to do this we need to compete in tour events and try to accumulate enough CTRS points to earn a spot into the 12 team field.

 What makes our team unique is that three of our team members are still eligible to compete at the junior level (21 and under) and while their main focus is with the Men's team, they will also try to win back to back Canadian Junior titles after capturing the title last year.


As a new/young team on tour we are excited for the opportunity to compete against some of the World's best teams and to learn what it takes to play at the highest level. The 2016-2017 season will be a great learning experience for our team and we are looking forward to pushing ourselves to see what we are capable of.


There are many expenses that come with travelling around the country competing at the highest level, such as; airfare, accommodations, vehicle rental - to name a few. Not to mention the entry fee for events which typically ranges from $800 to $1200. This is why we need your support. All donations will directly help fund our season. By contributing you will help us reach our goals and be part of our journey to the 2017 Olympic Pre-Trials and beyond. We can not do it without you!

SUPPORTERS",Automobile Racing,about me +ever since i can remember i’ve had a passion for motorsport  making my family visit go kart tracks on any holiday we went on or later when filming on locations with colleagues ++after filming motorsport for years  i thought i could beat half of the racers i saw  but they were the ones doing it  not me  a few years ago  on advice from a v8 ute driver after winning a racing at a v8 track day  i took the leap of faith to chase my dream of motorsport racing in australia in the holden hq nsw championship  also creating my go nuts racing team  my car had a tired engine  but that never stopped me to make the most with the little i had to be as competitive as possible  starting out i was often at the back  but improved each year from 19th  to 12th and then 5th (2nd in b division) +i read books  studied videos and took advice on improving the car setup and my craft and put it into practice  i had no delusions of grandeur that i would be the fastest driver or set poles  but i worked out how to put a championship together with the car i had and focused on consistent finishes and promoting my sponsors ++i progressed and was voted most improved driver as well as earning runner up in the 2010 nsw championships  beating competitors with faster cars and much bigger budgets than mine ++a move to new zealand for work forced me to sell my race car  and for a period i gave up on being able to purse any immediate motorsport dreams ++i was just at the point with my racing where i stopped before i got to see what i was capable of  which has bugged me ever since  it was always a privilege to race  but i still wondered what i could do with equivalent equipment to other drivers  i stopped at a point where my skills exceeded my cars ability  as i had lacked funds to make necessary improvements to advance ++the passion for racing has never left me  i love nothing more than racing as it is when i feel most alive  i especially enjoy sharing the feeling  excitement and successes with the people supporting me  desire has never been an issue for me  financial backing has been the main hindrance holding me back ++i've recently been selected from thousands of applicants to join the next qualifying stage of the amateur race drivers category in the 2018 aussie driver search competition  this has been setup to provide budding racing drivers a platform for the chance to compete for a grand prize of a  50 000 racing budget +campaign goals +hopefully this will be a 3 part campaign in the aussie driver search competition ++stage 1 – application to enter qualifying   success +this was a free online application  which i have been successfully accepted to enter the next stage  i'm guessing based on my experience and desire to compete ++stage 2 – qualifying at pukekohe  new zealand in august 2018 – next stage+things get serious  i now have the chance to drive for my life in a toyota 86 racing series car and nissan pulsar race car at pukekohe park raceway in new zealand to qualify and attempt to gain a spot into the finale eliminations ++drivers are judged by experienced race drivers being assessed on speed  consistency  mechanical sympathy and car control  all traits i developed previously while racing  only the top handful of drivers progressing onto the elimination rounds at wakefield ++stage 3 – the finale eliminations at wakefield  nsw australia in december 2018+this is dependent on successfully making it through qualifying +as fortune may have it  i’ve done many laps at wakefield in the past  so it’s a track very familiar to me if i do manage to get through  which hopefully holds some advantages  the top drivers are whittled down with the chosen winner on the day receiving a  50 000 racing budget for 2019  damn + +i'm raising funds for +at this point in life i see this as my best chance to get back into motorsport  and in a far more competitive level than i will ever be able to achieve without such an opportunity +i know i’m not the best driver ever  but i know given the access to the right equipment and surrounded by the right support  i can be super competitive in a championship  being able to race again would be amazing  to do it with backing  the icing on top for several unfulfilled dreams  especially to be part of a team again ++although this is an amazing opportunity just getting to qualifying doesn't come cheap  motorsport is expensive and there are many costs involved that i simply can't cover alone  so am looking for a team to join me on this journey to get there +the budget +there are several stages to this competition and more information is expected to arrive in the coming weeks  so i will post updates as i learn more  like any organised race team though  i have created a budget for each stage for expected costs with all funds dedicated to making each stage happen ++stage 2 – qualifying+i’ve allowed for the following costs +entry fee   1450   i have made a deposit to secure my spot  but now have 11 weeks until around 20th april to finalise the remainder+insurance   240+cams day license   115 – (no info yet  but i assume this is the right one   )+return flights to auck   230 (alternate is to hire a toyota 86 and driver up to get familiar with the car i'll be racing…it’s a 6hr drive so depends on timings of the event)+transfers  food and accommodation   205   hopefully i can minimise this and bunk with a friend instead   ++qualifying total inc fund campaign fees   2240 ++stage 3 – the finale eliminations (not included in this campaign amount)+this is dependent on being successful in qualifying  which i will consider as a 2nd part to this campaign only if i make it through  if funds raised exceed stage 1  naturally they will be used for stage 2 if i'm successful +otherwise for interest  entry to the finale is free if selected  but there are still associated costs to make it to the track in australia  i’ve allowed for return flights from wellington nz to sydney  cams license  insurance  travel and accommodation (though am expecting family in sydney to provide this to reduce costs)  currently i’m budgeting  960  i figure one step at a time  but worth mentioning so all cards are on the table ++if for any reason we raise more funds than required i would like to donate these funds for treatment for my cousin’s beautiful daughter who has been affected by this terrible condition and has needed much treatment overseas since it isn’t currently recognised in australia   ++why i need your support +racing is a team sport  and not something anyone can do alone  i know as i've been there before  and the success i achieved was only due to others that supported me ++i initially felt this would be out of reach given the costs involved to be able to take the chance to enter  but i finally decided to apply anyway  i then got accepted to compete at qualifying which was bittersweet as i didn’t know how i was going to afford it  even as i eyed off things around the house to sell ++it wasn't until friends urged me to take this opportunity and start a campaign  that i started believing this may even be possible  once

Ever since I can remember I’ve had a passion for motorsport, making my family visit go-kart tracks on any holiday we went on or later when filming on locations with colleagues.

After filming motorsport for years, I thought I could beat half of the racers I saw, but they were the ones doing it, not me. A few years ago, on advice from a V8 Ute Driver after winning a racing at a V8 Track Day, I took the leap of faith to chase my dream of motorsport racing in Australia in the Holden HQ NSW Championship, also creating my Go Nuts Racing team. My car had a tired engine, but that never stopped me to make the most with the little I had to be as competitive as possible. Starting out I was often at the back, but improved each year from 19th, to 12th and then 5th (2nd in B Division).
I read books, studied videos and took advice on improving the car setup and my craft and put it into practice. I had no delusions of grandeur that I would be the fastest driver or set poles, but I worked out how to put a Championship together with the car I had and focused on consistent finishes and promoting my Sponsors.

I progressed and was voted Most Improved Driver as well as earning Runner Up in the 2010 NSW Championships, beating competitors with faster cars and much bigger budgets than mine.

A move to New Zealand for work forced me to sell my race car, and for a period I gave up on being able to purse any immediate motorsport dreams.

I was just at the point with my racing where I stopped before I got to see what I was capable of, which has bugged me ever since. It was always a privilege to race, but I still wondered what I could do with equivalent equipment to other drivers. I stopped at a point where my skills exceeded my cars ability, as I had lacked funds to make necessary improvements to advance.

The passion for racing has never left me. I love nothing more than racing as it is when I feel most alive. I especially enjoy sharing the feeling, excitement and successes with the people supporting me. Desire has never been an issue for me, financial backing has been the main hindrance holding me back.

I've recently been selected from thousands of applicants to join the next Qualifying stage of the Amateur Race Drivers category in the 2018 Aussie Driver Search competition. This has been setup to provide budding racing drivers a platform for the chance to compete for a grand prize of a $50,000 racing budget.
CAMPAIGN GOALS:
Hopefully this will be a 3-part campaign in the Aussie Driver Search competition.

Stage 1 – Application to enter Qualifying - SUCCESS!
This was a free online application, which I have been successfully accepted to enter the next Stage, I'm guessing based on my experience and desire to compete.

Stage 2 – Qualifying at Pukekohe, New Zealand in August 2018 – NEXT STAGE
Things get serious. I now have the chance to drive for my life in a Toyota 86 Racing Series Car and Nissan Pulsar Race Car at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand to Qualify and attempt to gain a spot into the Finale eliminations.

Drivers are judged by experienced race drivers being assessed on speed, consistency, mechanical sympathy and car control, all traits I developed previously while racing. Only the top handful of drivers progressing onto the elimination rounds at Wakefield.

Stage 3 – The Finale Eliminations at Wakefield, NSW Australia in December 2018
This is dependent on successfully making it through Qualifying.
As fortune may have it, I’ve done many laps at Wakefield in the past, so it’s a track very familiar to me if I do manage to get through, which hopefully holds some advantages. The top drivers are whittled down with the chosen winner on the day receiving a $50,000 racing budget for 2019. Damn!
 
I'M RAISING FUNDS FOR:
At this point in life I see this as my best chance to get back into motorsport, and in a far more competitive level than I will ever be able to achieve without such an opportunity.
I know I’m not the best driver ever, but I know given the access to the right equipment and surrounded by the right support, I can be super competitive in a Championship. Being able to race again would be amazing, to do it with backing, the icing on top for several unfulfilled dreams, especially to be part of a team again.

Although this is an amazing opportunity just getting to Qualifying doesn't come cheap. Motorsport is expensive and there are many costs involved that I simply can't cover alone, so am looking for a team to join me on this journey to get there.
THE BUDGET:
There are several Stages to this competition and more information is expected to arrive in the coming weeks, so I will post updates as I learn more. Like any organised race team though, I have created a budget for each Stage for expected costs with all funds dedicated to making each stage happen.

Stage 2 – Qualifying
I’ve allowed for the following costs:
Entry Fee: $1450 - I have made a deposit to secure my spot, but now have 11 weeks until around 20th April to finalise the remainder
Insurance: $240
CAMS day license: $115 – (no info yet, but I assume this is the right one...)
Return flights to Auck: $230 (alternate is to hire a Toyota 86 and driver up to get familiar with the car I'll be racing…it’s a 6hr drive so depends on timings of the event)
Transfers, food and accommodation: $205 - hopefully I can minimise this and bunk with a friend instead...

QUALIFYING TOTAL inc fund campaign fees: $2240.

Stage 3 – The Finale Eliminations (not included in this campaign amount)
This is dependent on being successful in Qualifying, which I will consider as a 2nd part to this Campaign only if I make it through. If funds raised exceed Stage 1, naturally they will be used for Stage 2 if I'm successful.
Otherwise for interest, entry to the Finale is free if selected, but there are still associated costs to make it to the track in Australia. I’ve allowed for return flights from Wellington NZ to Sydney, CAMS license, insurance, travel and accommodation (though am expecting family in Sydney to provide this to reduce costs). Currently I’m budgeting $960. I figure one step at a time, but worth mentioning so all cards are on the table.

If for any reason we raise more funds than required I would like to donate these funds for treatment for my cousin’s beautiful daughter who has been affected by this terrible condition and has needed much treatment overseas since it isn’t currently recognised in Australia.  

WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT:
Racing is a team sport, and not something anyone can do alone. I know as I've been there before, and the success I achieved was only due to others that supported me.

I initially felt this would be out of reach given the costs involved to be able to take the chance to enter, but I finally decided to apply anyway. I then got accepted to compete at Qualifying which was bittersweet as I didn’t know how I was going to afford it, even as I eyed off things around the house to sell.

It wasn't until friends urged me to take this opportunity and start a campaign, that I started believing this may even be possible. Once again it showed me how much this is a team sport, and the importance of others support even before I get in a car. This is an ambitious task as I know I'll be up against other talented drivers but do believe I have the traits and potential they are looking for in a driver to give it a great shot.

With your support I can reach this first Stage of Qualifying, and then hopefully the Finale. I would love you to join me on this exciting journey, any contribution, big or small, is greatly appreciated. Please feel free to share my campaign with your friends and family that might also like to be part of this motorsport dream, and many thanks especially if you've read this far.

No two Olympic quadrennials are the same. This round of four years, we have made it our mission to make sure it's not the same. Beijing 2008 was a year when Obee had not even touched an oar and Lindsay was attending the games as an alternate. The quadrennial of London 2012 was very result-driven and so when our double finished the racing in 7th place, emotions were drained, self-confidence was low and the feeling that all that work had been for nothing was present. The upcoming Olympic games are to be held in August 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and we are determined to make the journey successful and fun. What better place in the world to culminate a fun olympic campaign than in the city of carnivals, beaches and night life.

On behalf of the Juan de Fuca Atom C5 team, we would like to extend an invitation to you to help support our 2016-2017 season.  Youth hockey is the most expensive sport for children; ice time, equipment, and travel costs add up very quickly.  More importantly however, ice hockey provides the opportunity of personal growth through hard work, commitment to team, leadership, and good sportsmanship. 
Our team of 16 boys and girls aged 9-10 years has lofty goals of entering three (3) island hockey tournaments this year, ice rental time, as well as acquiring practice jerseys for the kids.   
As parents, we’ve been pounding the pavement trying to locate a sponsor to offset some of these costs, with the remainder coming from bottle drives, chocolate sales, and donations from friends and family alike. 
We are looking for people willing to donate any dollar amount to help these youngsters with their season goals.  We also continue to look for a team sponsor, whom we could recognize with your business name printed on the back of the jersey, a thank you plaque with team photo for display at your business location, and your business named on a thank you advertisement on Facebook or similar media.

We have 30 youth members ranging in age from 8 to 25 years old. Every year we participate in flat water competitions around the country. One of our athletes greatly excelled this year winning nationals and representing Italy in both the World and European championship races making it to finals.
You would think in a city famous for its canals and gondoliers would be the ideal place to practice water sports. Not so. Overtourism, roughly 30 million per year, has had a significant effect on our home of 50,000 residents. Sadly, the astronomical increase of waves generated by tourist boat traffic (e.g., water taxis racing to and from the airport, day tripper ferries, hotel linen service boats, food delivery boats, septic pump boats, ambulance speed boats, trash boats ect.) have made it impossible for us to train on the choppy waters at our rowing club established in 1901. Two winters ago the kids would come up on the dock as blue as our team stripes, because of repeatedly capsizing in some boat's wake.
Thanks to the tenacity and dedication of our coaches, new training areas with flat smooth water near Malamocco and Treporti were found. The athletes travel about an hour to practice now. Everyone is focused on preparing for next season. We are passionate, but poor.
We would like to buy a new boat and some equipment, cover the expenses to attend a training camp and keep up the maintenance on our team van and trailers. A donation of any amount is welcome.
Become an honored sponsor and help save a 120 year old club that actually benefits the Venetian community.

Only recently a year ago I came to know about road cycling, I was totally fascinated 
I bought a bike 7 months ago, a very basic bike and started practicing for races until I meet a accident. I was not very severaly injured but my bike was
My campaign goals:
I am running this campaing to get my bike fixed again and if possible upgrade some stuff like, from flat pedal to clipless and better tyres, some kind of basic bike computer instead of my own phone 
I was born in india, here cycling is not very popular and no one really knows the existence of cycling as a sport 
When I cycle around and people see me they get a interest and ask me about it, I like the way the children see me going faster than them on a cycle, hope this will encourage children's to take up cycling 
If I get some good amount of funding I will practice everyday and take part in event, I hope to reach atleast my nation event

I started when I was a kid in times of USSR.

I started swimming competitively at the age of 7 with the Kriviy Rig ""Bogatyr"" Aquatic Club. I loved racing other kids! Although I played many other sports like tennis, soccer, but swimming was the number one for me.


When I was 12 years old, I was chosen to be selected by one of the best coaches in our city who was famous for training an Olympian swimmer. Immediately I started dreaming about fulfilling my dream of reaching a national level.
I continued to improve and grow as an athlete and as a person over the next decade. Unfortunately, at 90s the Soviet Union broke apart and nobody really cared or funded sports anymore. People had to survive including my coach. As the result, my dream crushed due to political changes in my country.
Nevertheless, I continued swimming as much as I could and today I'm still swimming and competing as a Masters swimmer. Last year was pretty successful: 1st place at Canadian Masters Swimming Championship in 1500 free (in my age group) and 3rd place at Canadian Open Water Swimming Championship in 2.5k. (all ages, both male and female).

Now I'm still swimming and recently started teaching others (both kids and adults) to swim!
What do I need? As a novice coach I have many expenses and minimal funding. My primary expenses include pool lanes rental, traveling, living expenses, and technical equipment. Also I've been dreaming about a good quality underwater camera system and a swim technique analysis software.

Les Sparks de Valleyfield existent depuis maintenant quatre ans. Cette année notre équipe visait un objectif : se qualifier pour les championnats mondiaux de cheerleading en avril prochain. Ça n’a pas été une tâche facile, il fallait se classer dans les meilleures équipes de niveau 5 ou 6 contre d’excellents clubs du Québec et d’autres provinces. Après quelques tentatives et embûches cette année, les Sparks se méritent enfin un laissez-passer pour la compétition la plus importante au monde en cheerleading. Nous avons travaillé si fort pour atteindre ce but et nous sommes motivés plus que jamais à performer sur le sol des Worlds!

Ce grand championnat mondial de cheerleading aura lieu du 24 au 30 avril prochain à Walt Disney, en Floride. Nous sommes honorés et fiers de représenter le Canada aux Worlds 2014 pour la première fois. Votre soutien est important, aidez-nous à réaliser notre rêve en faisant un don.

The University of Arizona’s Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration Student Chapter needs your help! Students in our chapter are competing at the 42nd Annual Intercollegiate Mining Games in Central City, Colorado, and are in need of funding for travel to the competition.
 The Intercollegiate Mining Games are held each year in memory of miners who lost their lives in the 1972 Sunshine Mine disaster. The competition is comprised of events that utilize traditional mining methods such as jackleg drilling, laying track and gold panning. Students and alumni from all over the world travel to compete, making this a unique event in the mining industry.
The University of Arizona teams had a good showing at the 2019 competition, winning several individual events and taking home third overall in the Co-Ed division. For 2020 we are planning to send 3 teams (18 students), but will need support to make this goal a reality. Your generous donation will help fund safe travel, accommodation and registration fees for this once-in-a-lifetime trip.

Mijn naam is Sebastiaan Röell. Sinds deze week maak ik officieel deel uit van Jong Oranje Lacrosse. In de zomer van 2020 nemen we deel aan de World Cup in Ierland. Omdat Lacrosse geen grote sport is in Nederland, is er niet veel budget voor ons beschikbaar. Een groot deel van de kosten voor deelname aan het WK moet door de spelers zelf betaald worden. In totaal komt dit uit op een bedrag van ongeveer € 3.000,- per speler. Via deze weg probeer ik dan ook mensen en/of bedrijven te vinden die mij willen helpen om volgend jaar op het WK te kunnen spelen. Hieronder staan verschillende 'donatie' pakketten. Maar natuurlijk kunt u ook zelf een bedrag invullen.

Hello,
My name is Sebastiaan Röell and I am from the Netherlands. As of this week I am officially a part of the Men’s Dutch National Lacrosse Team under 19. We will be playing at the World Cup in Ireland next summer. Unfortunately, because Lacrosse is such a small sport in the Netherlands, there is very little budget available for us. A large part of the costs for participating in the World Cup has to be payed by the players themselves. In total it amounts to around € 3.000 per player. This is the reason I am reaching out. I hope that people and/or companies are willing to help me get together the money I need to make it to the World Cup. Listed below you will find different ‘donation’ packages or you can fill in an amount yourself.

Para convertirme en un atleta de clase mundial tengo que empujar mis límites y desarrollar una autodisciplina increíble. La cosa es, quiero más, sé que puedo hacer más. Estoy listo para empujar mis límites aún más, ya que sé que puedo trabajar mi camino al podio.
Para poder alcanzar estos objetivos este año tengo que pagar USD12,000 para entrenar por 10 semanas en el Canadian Olimpic en Calgary. Por eso necesito su apoyo. Todas las donaciones ayudarán directamente a financiar mi proyecto. Al contribuir me ayudará a alcanzar mis metas, pero también participará en nuestro viaje de convertirme en un medallista de oro.
PORTUGUESE
Meu nome é Augustinho Teixeira e sou snowboarder já metade da minha vida.
Atualmente, estou no 1º lugar da federação brasileira (boardercross) e na federação argentina (slopestyle). Os meus principais objetivos deste ano serão: estar entre os 20 melhores no ranking canadense da minha categoria no final da temporada e estar no pódio como parte do meu plano de 4 anos para chegar às Olimpíadas em 2022.
Minha viagem como snowboarder me ensinou muito sobre mim, como meus pontos fortes e fracos, e o quanto eu tenho que me esforçar fisicamente e mentalmente. Fui a competições de snowboard na Argentina, Brasil e Alberta (Canadá), onde aprendi muito mais sobre esse esporte. Para me tornar um atleta de classe mundial, tenho que empurrar meus limites e desenvolver uma autodisciplina incrível. Pois é, eu quero mais, eu sei que posso fazer mais. Estou pronto para empurrar meus limites ainda mais, já que eu sei que posso trabalhar meu caminho ao pódio.
Para alcançar esses objetivos, este ano eu tenho que pagar US $ 12.000 para treinar por 10 semanas no Canadian Olympic em Calgary. É por isso que eu preciso do seu apoio. Todas as doações ajudarão diretamente a financiar meu projeto. Contribuir vai me ajudar a alcançar meus objetivos, mas também você será parte dessa jornada para eu me tornar medalhista de ouro.",,,,,,

The National Lacrosse Association (NLA) is a professional field lacrosse league in North America. Headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, the NLA currently has two teams that will expand to nine by  as the league sets its sights on becoming the premier professional lacrosse league in the United States.
Mission
To intentionally diversify the sport of lacrosse and alter its aesthetics by allowing some of the most notable and unknown Black, Indigenous, Latino, Hispanic, and Asian athletes the opportunity to play lacrosse at a professional level.

1 of 1: How the NLA is Different From Other Professional Lacrosse Leagues
Game Flow
Unlike traditional lacrosse, the NLA has modified its field and rules to provide a more up-tempo, entertaining style of play. Our field and rule modifications will enable our teams to increase their possessions and score more goals.
Other professional lacrosse leagues average 10-15 goals per game; the NLA’s projected average goals per game is significantly higher as we expect our teams to score around 20-30 goals per game.

How The NLA Is Solving Lacrosse’s Problems
Lack of Diversity
The NLA is more inclusive than any other professional lacrosse league in North America. It’s not enough to preach diversity and inclusion without any action behind it. The NLA has assumed the task of growing the game of lacrosse and changing the sports’ aesthetics by placing a significant emphasis on diversity and inclusion. The players on our rosters and our executive and front office staff are a direct reflection of the emphasis we are placing on diversity and inclusion as it pertains to growing the game of lacrosse.
Developing A Standard For Professional Lacrosse
We aim to set a standard for professional lacrosse through performance-based evaluations and player combines. The NLA has a group of dedicated scouts situated throughout the United States whose number one priority is identifying and evaluating player performance and physical readiness amongst amateur and collegiate athletes. The combines we host allow our coaches and scouts the opportunity to evaluate prospects in person through a series of drills, exercises, and interviews. Thus, giving each player an equal chance of fulfilling their dreams of playing professional lacrosse.
Community Outreach
Our league and its members have unprecedented access to low-middle socioeconomic and traditional lacrosse communities. We have a keen understanding of what needs to be done to change lacrosse's culture regarding the players that have been marginalized within the sport. Having such access enables us to attack lacrosse's issues at the grassroots level and provide support and funding to help lacrosse programs in underserved communities thrive.

""Why the NLA? It's simple; there are a lot of talented players and coaches out there who haven't been considered to be apart of a professional organization. My professional playing career provided me with amazing opportunities throughout my life. I have dedicated my life to using lacrosse as a vehicle to provide those type of opportunities to others, and the NLA has provided me a chance to do that at a professional level.""

 ""It's a band of brothers cut from the same cloth; but walked through all different experiences in life. A Marauder on the field; but finding a home in the meaning behind the NLA off the field.""


NLA Draft: Where Dreams Come True
The inaugural NLA draft took place on September 11th, 2001.
On that day, 46 players were drafted, which means 46 players were able to fulfill their  lifelong dreams of playing lacrosse at the professional level.
Below you'll find a video of Matt Valdez where he celebrates with his family after being selected to the Marauders with the 11th overall pick along with a graphic highlighting the first five players selected.

The Brains Behind the NLA
  Arthur Johnson; Founder/Commissioner
Arthur Johnson started playing Lacrosse while at East Stroudsburg University for while studying Exercise Science.  After being called a racial slur at a lacrosse club party, Johnson's attitude toward the sport changed. That singular incident became the fuel he needed to pursue the sport as a serious activity. Instead of fighting physically, in 2010, he launched, The Re-Education Foundation (TREF), which is a 501(c)3 non-profit that focuses on nontraditional activities for youth and young adults. His youth Lacrosse program since then has assisted in over thirty high school graduates who have attained lacrosse scholarships to play at the collegiate level.
The son of two retired Philadelphia school teachers, quickly grew throughout the lacrosse coaching ranks after graduating college. Making stops in public and private high schools in PA and MD. In addition to multiple NCAA collegiate programs including Lebanon Valley College as the Faceoff Coordinator.
Johnson created the Minorities in Lacrosse group on Facebook to unite all fronts of lacrosse. The page has spawned most black owned social media outlets, dubbing Johnson a key figure in the Lacrosse world.

The NLA intends to have a significant impact on the lacrosse community which will felt for years to come.

Justin's journey of being a Mixed Martial Artist has taught him so much about himself, such as his strengths and weaknesses, and how hard he can push himself physically and mentally. Justin has competed in FCP 3 CAGED CHAOS, FCP 4 CAGED CHAOS & FCP CAGED CHAOS in 2013 where I learned so much more about my sport. To become a world-class athlete he has had to push his limits and develop incredible self-discipline all while overcoming major obstacles in his personal life. The thing is, he wants more, he knows he can do more. Justin is ready to push his limits even further as he knows that he can work his way onto a podium.
To be able to reach these goals this year we have to hit $3000. This is why we need your support. All donations will directly help us fund Justin's fees. By contributing you will help us reach our goals but you will also take part in our journey & become a part of the Broken World Family.",7.0,6.0,7.0,16.0,4.0,12.0

Team GB will be travelling to Tokyo on the 18th May to train with individuals such as Ozawa sensei and the members of their dojo in preparation for the WKC at the Nippon Budokan.  Through the efforts of the BKA and the management team, the cost has been reduced for each person, but this time spent in Tokyo before the main event will be self-funded by each individual member of the team.
In the team competition we are against Croatia and New Zealand.  The winner of this group will go on to face the winner of group 9 (which includes the USA, France, Malaysia and Greece) in the next round.

All money raised will go towards the costs of the travel and the time spent training in Tokyo in the build up to the WKC and preparing to compete against some of the World's best.

Many children start off with a taster session at school and this can quickly become the child’s highlight of the school week. Many children then go on the play at a club and start group sessions. This quickly turns into the child’s passion and they dream of what it may be like to live the life of a professional tennis player. However, the dreams of becoming a professional tennis player for a gifted child can quickly be diminished due to financial constraints placed on the family. We believe that no child should be denied the opportunity to live out their dreams and more importantly become the inspiration for other children to take up tennis and pursue their dreams.
There are many famous cases of players coming from financially challenged backgrounds. The most famous is the story of the Williams sisters and their father Richard. He originally trained his daughters on the park courts in a tough neighbourhood in Compton, before being backed financially. These two sisters are now arguably the inspiration every female tennis player of every background. 
In the Men’s game, you have Francis Tiafoe and the Murray brothers. Little was known about the financial struggles these players faced. Some parents have re-mortgaged their homes and taken out large loans to give their children the chance to live their dreams, risking everything they own to give their child the opportunity.     
The reality of performance tennis is that for the thousands that try many will fall short and not make the desired impact on their dream. However we don’t view these as failures as although it may not get the desired outcome, that child was given a chance. This is the most important thing in our opinion it’s the chance to make a difference. 
GO-2-PRO is the brainchild of Kristine Ricardsone and Martin Skinner. Kristine was a parent in the situation of having a child that didn’t have the financial backing and wasn’t able to help her daughter realise her dreams. Martin Skinner is a Strength and conditioning coach working with professional and aspiring tennis players. His involvement has come from equal frustration on having some of the most talented children unable to take their tennis to the next level due to financial constraints. Martin regularly give up his time to help underprivileged players to help them get the best out of their bodies physically. 
Thank you for reading and please if you can help it would be forever grateful. Even by simply passing on the word that there is something out there to allow children to achieve their dreams.

1990’s  my training with the royal marines and the fitness i gained from that training gave me the courage to tackle my first marathon 26 384 miles (42 2 kilometres) in 1998 and i ran it in 3 hrs 38 minutes  over the last 20 years or so i have been fortunate enough to combine my love of running together with travelling and i have ran in several world class international marathons + i have ran the london marathon over a dozen times  i have also ran 8 marathons in united state of america  3 paris  2 berlin  2 vienna  2 venice  stockholm  frankfurt  florence  i have ran 4 marathons this year namely prague  copenhegan and liverpool city rock n roll maranthon and in moscow   i have been running regularly since about 1998 and i average about 3 marathons every year  as mentioned above i think i can safely say that i am the only nigerian that has ran over 50 international marathons and counting   + in all of the marathons that i have taken part in  i can say 99 9% of these marathons have all been won by young east africa country men and women and usually by kenyans  ethiopians and morocco  never from west africa countries  they are definitely no nigerian winners  there are no known nigerians on the international stage of long distance running  why is this + as a nigerian this borders me  how is it possible that kenyans  ethiopians and other east africa countries with population less than that of nigeria are able to produce such high level top class elite long distance runners  but my nigeria the most populous black nation on earth with the biggest population in africa is not able to do so  a kenyan runner has just recently broken the world record running a marathon in under 2 hours + there is an internationally accepted theory that africans are natural born runners  that africans have special genes hence they are able to run faster and for longer distance  there may be some elements of truth in these theories  but i personally do not believe this is completely true  my believe is that the east africans have grown up with long distance race winners within communities  they have role models of long distance runner  they have seen one of theirs own win the london marathon  new york marathons  paris marathon and returned home with a big fat cheques of £150 000 or more and transform their lives and that of their communities through the sport of long distance running  the same can be said of football in nigeria  most nigerians have seen nigeria football stars all over the world and children have grown up wanting to be the same  it is because nigeria has several famous world class footballers that we have new generations of nigeria youths growing up and wanting to be football star  role modeling is the biggest factor in the long history of east african amazing long distance runners rathar than talent     +we have a football culture in nigeria but not a long distance running culture  my ambition is to change this  to create a running culture  to create long distance running role models within my community  my state of origin and to grow this into something big  my aim therefore  is to start something small that will begin to create the type of role models that others will want to follow  i believe l can achieve this through encouraging and creating the environment within secondary schools levels and starting with 10 kilometre road

Over the last 20 years or so I have been fortunate enough to combine my love of running together with travelling and I have ran in several World Class international Marathons.
 I have ran the London Marathon over a dozen times. I have also ran 8 marathons in United State of America. 3 Paris, 2 Berlin, 2 Vienna, 2 Venice, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Florence. I have ran 4 marathons this year namely Prague, Copenhegan and Liverpool City Rock n Roll Maranthon and in Moscow . I have been running regularly since about 1998 and I average about 3 Marathons every year. As mentioned above I think I can safely say that I am the only Nigerian that has ran over 50 international Marathons and counting.  
 In all of the marathons that I have taken part in, I can say 99.9% of these marathons have all been won by young East Africa Country men and women and usually by Kenyans, Ethiopians and Morocco. Never from west Africa countries. They are definitely no Nigerian winners. There are no known Nigerians on the international stage of long distance running. Why is this?
 As a Nigerian this borders me. How is it possible that Kenyans, Ethiopians and other East Africa countries with population less than that of Nigeria are able to produce such high level top class elite long distance runners, but my Nigeria the most populous Black nation on earth with the biggest population in Africa is not able to do so. A Kenyan Runner has just recently broken the world record running a marathon in under 2 hours.
 There is an internationally accepted theory that Africans are natural born runners. That Africans have special genes hence they are able to run faster and for longer distance. There may be some elements of truth in these theories. But I personally do not believe this is completely true. My believe is that the East Africans have grown up with long distance race winners within communities. They have role models of long distance runner. They have seen one of theirs own win the London Marathon, New York Marathons, Paris Marathon and returned home with a big fat cheques of £150,000 or more and transform their lives and that of their communities through the sport of long distance running. The same can be said of Football in Nigeria. Most Nigerians have seen Nigeria football stars all over the world and children have grown up wanting to be the same. It is because Nigeria has several famous world class footballers that we have new generations of Nigeria youths growing up and wanting to be football star. Role modeling is the biggest factor in the long history of East African amazing long distance runners rathar than talent.    
We have a football culture in Nigeria but not a long distance running culture. My ambition is to change this, to create a running culture, to create long distance running role models within my community, my state of origin and to grow this into something big. My aim therefore, is to start something small that will begin to create the type of role models that others will want to follow. I believe l can achieve this through encouraging and creating the environment within secondary schools levels and starting with 10 kilometre Road Race challenge and then grow this until it can be double and one day get to half and full marathon.
I also want to make this a mass participation event.
I have already began this Journey and wish to take it further and expand it further.
My First Sponsored Event
On the 3rd February this year successfully organised, staged and sponsored the the first Urhobo Secondary schools 10k Road Race in Ughelli.
The event was a resounding success. It was very well received and loved by all the students that took part. The race began from Ughelli Stadium, out unto Ughelli Patani Road which was partially closed to traffic and then returned back to the finish line at the stadium.
The Race catered for 500 students of which 376 turned up on the day. All 376 students completed the 10k road race. The first students to cross the finishing line won the first prize of #75,000 naira each and their schools got exactly the same amount. The second male and female got #50,000 naira each and their schools the same. The third students got #25,000 naira each as and their schools the same. Every participant received a medal, a t-shirt and a bag containing drinks, fruits and snacks. There was a genuine party atmosphere in the stadium.
I want to double this success story by repeating the event next year for a 1000 youths.  I then want to do the same in the state capital Asaba in Delta State Nigeria.
I sponsored the First Urhobo Secondary Schools 10k Road Race personally out of my pocket and at a great personal cost. This included bringing from the UK, the medals, t-shirts and the goodies Bag that was presented to every runner on the day. I am unable to personally afford the financial cost again on my own in repeating the Ughelli event next year and to bring the event to the state capital on my own, financially and hence the approach to Sportfunder for support/partnership to be able to repeat the Ughelli event and to bring the event to the state capital Asaba.",27.0,3.0,4.0,50.0,7.0,32.0

It is not a mystery that Venezuela is going through one of the biggest social, political, and economic crisis in its history. Many players lack the resources to afford the full expenses of international events. The average cost of the tournament for athletes is approximately $2000, and that does not include travel expenses, accommodations, and competition entry fees. The money raised will go directly to cover costs related to:
- Transport
- Hotel
- Meals
- Competition fees
- Team clothing for competition
- Sports care
The process is long, takes patience, perseverance, and dedicated athletes and organization to make it happen. Waraos Ultimate has 23 athletes, coaches and support staff working together to get ready for the 2018 summer season. Check out our Biography to learn more about the history of them team.

For those of you that are new to the team, we are Tepa United FC located in Torrance, CA. We are a Five-Time Championship Team and are looking to bring our sixth championship this upcoming season!
We currently play in the Premier Division of the South Bay Peninsula Soccer League, which is the biggest and best adult men's soccer league in Southern California. Our goal is straightforward...win! 
Many of our athletes come from either collegiate playing experience and/or long years of competitive high-level soccer. With long work hours (all of our players working themselves) traditional fundraisers can be incredibly difficult for our team. Every season, the cost incurred by each player can often hit upwards of $500 after purchasing uniforms, registration for leagues and tournaments, and purchasing the necessary gear.
Whether you are an individual contributor or a sponsor we truly appreciate your support! Our biggest goal at the moment is to find this upcoming seasons jersey sponsor! Please feel free to look through our available offerings with each donation. We assure that your brand will be represented in the highest regard both on and off the field.
By contributing, you are giving back to a hardworking group of young men who strive to improve our representation in the community in every way possible. We want to continue to share our love for the game with the community and hopefully inspire young athletes across the community to continue to strive in becoming the best the can possibly be.
We are asking for your support and to help spread the word! Thank you for anything you can contribute.

Sawadee krap,
I feel very blessed and honoured to be selected to represent Canada this year at the IFMA world championships in Sweden. This is my second opportunity as i competed last year in Thailand. After a disappointing conclusion to my participation last year, I've been hoping for a chance at Redemption.
I've been training in Muay Thai since 2005 and have never looked back. I fell in love with the art and developed a thirst for more knowledge. I suffered a significant injury that sidelined me in 2006, but made it my personal mission to get well enough to continue training in the art. I didn't have my first fight until 2009. it wasn't till then that i knew that i was meant to compete. I have made many accomplishments and received many accolades in Muay Thai. 2 provincial titles, 1 national title, but none greater than the opportunity to Represent Canada in what would be considered as the ""Olympics"" of Muay Thai. I am very proud to be a Canadian Athlete and plan to Represent my Country to the best of my ability. I go for Gold This year and Nothing less!!!
Although we are proud and happy to represent Canada in Muay Thai on this World Stage, It is not an Olympic Sport and Funding is left to the athletes to Raise ourselves. I often wish that our government bodies would see the benefits of supporting its Nation's Athletes, as other countries do, especially with the fact that Some of the Top Muay Thai Fighters in the World are from right here in Canada. We are left to manage this for ourselves which often makes it difficult to focus on the task at hand. Our Cost Include, Travel, Accommodation, Admin fees, Uniform, Food and Transport, Lost wages, etc.. With this being said we appreciate any support from anyone who believes in Canadian Athletes representing our country in sport. I am hoping to raise the amount of $3000 to help cover the cost but any amount would help ease the financial burden and make this trip achievable..

The process is long, it takes patience, perseverance, and a very dedicated athlete and organization to make it happen. The Junior National Team has 24 athletes and 4 coaches and support staff working together to get ready for the season. We have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! To help us reach our goals in representing Canada on the world stage, fight for medals on the international circuit, and have the means to do so.
The athletes that will be going to these World Championships are ones that will be representing Canada for years to come, striving to attend the 2020 and 2024 Olympics and we want to ensure that they will have a taste of international competition while they are still developing and refining their skills. 
This year's team will consist of swimmers coming from all parts of Canada, making it a true ""A Mari Usque Ad Mare"" Canadian team, meaning the team will have athletes represented from sea to sea. Even though Canadian synchronized swimming is in excellent shape, the costs to accommodate swimmers from all over the country is extremely high. 
The average cost for our top athletes to reach the World Championships is approximately $10,000 per athlete, and that doesn't including living expenses. Athletes are responsible for covering expenses to attend all the necessary training camps, train year-round, travel and accommodation, competition entry fees, facility fees, and equipment, amongst other things. 
This campaign will also help raise funds for the swimmers from all over Canada travel to the training camp this December since the prices for traveling during holiday times are very expensive. We have picked the training camp to be at this time of year so the swimmers do not miss any school because we at Synchro Canada strongly believe in the value of education for elite athletes.

You are also becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, that is helping young athletes reach their dreams and achieve athletic excellence.

WHY WE'RE FUNDRAISING:
Muay Thai Ontario, an affiliate of Muaythai Canada, needs your help sponsoring the journey of these dedicated and talented athletes to the championships. It is our goal to take the financial burden off the athletes selected to the world stage and allow them to concentrate on training for the international championships.

During our fundraising last year we noted how Ontario is historically under-represented on the National Team and we were working hard to make that change. Ontarians now make up more than 50% of Team Canada, so with one goal accomplished we want to keep the momentum going and move towards a fully sponsored and funded team.
WHERE THE FUNDS GO:
Training, specialized coaching, nutrition, transportation, accommodations.
The journey to IFMA is long, it takes patience, perseverance, and a very dedicated athlete and organization to make it happen. Team Ontario has 11 athletes and numerous coaches and support staff working together to get ready. We have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! The total cost of the travel, accommodations, and associated expense total to around $3,000 per person! We've set our goal modestly; we aim to raise 20% of the team's needs.
·  $700-$900 for a round-trip flight to Sweden;
·  $1,800-$2,700 for 12-nights of accommodation and food;
·  $100 in registration fees; and
·  $100 in team uniforms.
By contributing, you are becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, that is helping these athletes reach their dreams and achieve athletic excellence and building a foundation of support for future athletes to come. Being a part of the Team Ontario is a big step forward in an athlete's development, and we believe we can take them to the next level.
We are asking for your support and to help spread the word! Please team up with us!
Yes, there are some risks
As is the case with any sport, there's always the risk that an athlete can get injured during the training leading up to competition. In the event of a withdrawal from the event, the funds will be evenly distributed among the remaining athletes representing Ontario.
PHYSICAL REWARDS
Muay Thai Ontario has partnered up with In Fight Style to create exclusive merchandise for supporters who would like a memento for their pledge. When choosing a physical reward, keep in mind that there are production and shipping costs to cover. This means that not all of your pledge will go directly to the athletes.
If you live around the Greater Toronto Area and would like to donate for a physical reward send us a message and let us know! We'll do our best to save you the shipping.
Physical rewards only ship to Canada.


AUCTION REWARDS
Auction items are unique rewards that supporters can bid on. At the end of the fundraising campaign the highest bidder will receive the auction item.


BACKGROUND ON 2016 IFMA MUAYTHAI WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP:
From May 17th to 30th 2016, the doors to the Kinnarps Arena in Jönköping, Sweden will open for the 17th IFMA Muaythai World Championship.
The IFMA Muaythai World Championship is one of the largest martial art events in the world with more than 2,000 athletes, officials, masters and 40,000 spectators for this 10 day competition where the best of international Muaythai amateurs will compete for the title of IFMA World Champion.
This event is organized by the International Federation of Muaythai Amateur. Their objective is to have total unification of all 130 member national federations, noting Muaythai Canada as one of the national federations, working mutually for the sport and the athletes.
IFMA bears the responsibility and duty of being the sole world-recognized international amateur Muaythai federation, promoting the sport and art of Muaythai around the globe. With the objective of total unification of all 130 member national federations, working mutually for the sport and the athletes, IFMA has been making the only push for official recognition of Muaythai by the International Olympic Committee (“IOC”).
Working towards the goal of bringing Muaythai to the Olympics, IFMA became fully recognized as an International Federation by SportAccord in 2006. In 2008, the IFMA World Championships were held as a part of The Association for International Sport for All’s “World Sport for All Games”, making it the first Muaythai event under the patronage of the IOC. 2010 marked the year when Muaythai was one of the 13 world recognized combat sport to be part of the World Combat Games in Beijing under the IOC, and the second edition of the event was held in 2013 in St Petersburg, Russia. The 2015 SportAccord Convention in Sochi marked a following milestone for IMFA as the International University Sports Federation (“FISU”) officially recognized Muaythai through signing an agreement between FISU and IFMA.
BACKGROUND ON MUAY THAI ONTARIO:

Muay Thai Ontario’s mission is to safely develop the sport and culture of amateur Muaythai in Ontario through programs that provide the highest quality educational, competitive, and financial support for the athletes, coaches, officials, and recreational members of the community. It is accomplished through competitions, coaching and officiating seminars as well as athlete development courses throughout the year. It is MTO’s mandate to provide Muaythai athletes a Muaythai organization with a strong direct lineage and path from Provincial to National to International through affiliates, such as Muaythai Canada and the International Federation of Muay Thai Amateur (“IFMA”).
Muay Thai Ontario focuses on the development of proper technique and teachings of Muaythai and is committed to providing safe, regulated competitions for Ontario athletes that are framed in a lineage and history of the sport. Equally as important, Muay Thai Ontario provides philosophical and martial art teachings of the sport that are embedded in the culture and traditions from which the sport originates, Thailand. Committed to upholding the highest ethical standards for all of its members in each of their respective roles, Muay Thai Ontario strives for fairness, equity, and transparency in policy, procedures and process. These principles frame the organization’s practices and guide the membership community.",28.0,5.0,7.0,50.0,8.0,46.0

Hey my name is Philip Osei, and i am a 24 year old Canadian national track and field team member. I compete in the 400m dash, and I’m currently ranked # 1 in the country.Still considering myself as an amateur to the sport, I have had some success within track and field, and made many major teams such as the:
2011 Pan-American Games
2012 NACAC under 23 Games (Silver medalist)
2013-2014 Penn Relays
2014-2015 IAAF World Relays in Bahamas
2014 commonwealth games (Glasgow Scotland)
2015  Pan-American Games
2015 NACAC Senior Championship (Costa Rica)
 In the early season of 2014, I suffered from plantar fasciitis which later led to a tear in my right foot. Being out for 3 months took its toll on me mentally and physically.  Fortunately I was able to get my act together and still place 3rd for the bronze at the Canadian championships! Qualifying for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow Scotland,I was able to competed to the best of my abilities, making it to the semi finals! Commonwealth being the last meet of the season I was able to fully heal afterwards and give the 2015 season my all.
This past June I returned to Canadian Championships more determined then ever and won my second national title qualifying me for the 2015 Pan-American Games  in Toronto! I got the special opportunity to compete in the 400m, and also the 4X400m relay.Just being able to train for the Pan am games was such a blessing since just a year prior i could barely walk into the season. I gave it my all and competed to the best of my abilities. With a personal best of 45.51 seconds, and a season best of 45.80 - I was only able to run 46.80 in the semis, which made me ineligible for the finals. Although I would have loved to be in the finals, I took what i learned from my Pan Am experience And still knew there was a chance to get the Olympic standard which would qualify me for Rio.
After putting my Pan Am experience behind me, the following week I was named to join the NACAC senior team in Costa Rica. Going into competition I was determined to make a statement and that's exactly what I did. I set a new personal best time of 45.23 seconds! Hitting the Olympic standard, which made me adequate to run next year in the 2016 Rio Olympics! I'm proud to also say my recent performance is also the third fastest time ran by a Canadian.
I’ve never worked so hard in my life; despite my decent season in 2014 I was still stripped of my funding. This made training extremely hard on me. Funding myself for 2015 has been a roller coaster. I found myself in tight spots many times within the year; missing competitions, lack of nutrition; transportation to practice became difficult and after serious training sessions I wasn’t able to receive any treatment from my federations IST (Integrated Support Team)
looking forward into the 2016 Olympic year, your contribution will put my mind at ease making my training 100% more effective and geared towards the Olympics with no distractions.

 
My athletic goal is:
Represent Canada at the Olympics to the best of my abilities, potentially get into an Olympic Final.
I will be using the funds for:
It will go towards transportation, nutrition, coaching fees,competition, travel, training camps and IST (Integrated Support Team) that deal with athletic needs; such as soft tissue, phyiso and chiropractic treatment (IST)",8.0,1.0,6.0,18.0,1.0,17.0

Downhill skiing, basketball, and tennis are sports that I continually participate in, and love, but just less than 2 years ago I found PICKLEBALL and it has been life changing -  I have met many wonderful people, physically and mentally challenged myself and, for the first time, truly felt as though I'm making an impact on a sport.
I am currently ranked 4.0 (out of 5.0) in Pickleball. In singles play, I have achieved the silver medal at the 2018 US Open Championships and my mixed partner and I won the bronze in 4.0. Over the past year and a half, I have competed in 10 tournaments and received 11 medals; 4 gold, 2 silver and 4 bronze. My main goals this year are: to achieve a 4.5 ranking, to become a sponsored athlete and to participate in the 2018 Canadian National Tournament in Kelowna, British Columbia which occurs July 6-8, 2018!!
My journey of being a Pickleball athlete has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I have been to Florida and all across Ontario for tournaments which is where I learned so much more about my sport. To become a world-class athlete I had to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way onto a podium.
To be able to reach these goals this year I have to pay $2000+ because I'm not just fundraising for myself; I am trying to get my partner Brian and I to British Columbia to compete against the best in Canada and to travel to every remaining tournament scheduled in Ontario for the 2018 season. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my fees. By contributing you will help me reach my goals but you will also take part in our journey of becoming a gold medalist.",7.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,2.0,8.0

My name is Rachel Sklar and I am a young Canadian Ultramarathon runner. Two and a half years ago, I felt like there was a lack of pace in where my life was going. The anxiety of everyday life had overwhelmed me and I found myself dead in my tracks. I had two choices; find something above and beyond that would push me forward or succumb to slow and continuous rut. Having always been athletic, I needed something to break me out of the physical constraints that these anxieties had bound me in. The answer was simple. Running. The freedom that running had given me was the ability to see forward. I could run and run and run and still continue to break personal thresholds that I once thought were impossible. In September 2016, I finished my first marathon with tears in my eyes as I crossed the finish line. Because of my new found ability to push beyond my boundaries and within seven months, I fearlessly (for the most part) registered for La Mision race in Patagonia and managed to conquer 100 miles. 

In the time leading up to these remarkable achievements, I started to understand the inner workings of the running world; what I had come to realize was that there was a huge lack of Canadian presence on an international scale. So, I began to come up with a strategy in order to start pushing our presence forward, 12 internationally acclaimed races over the course of 12 months. Now, keep in mind; these are not just your average run of the mill races, they have been labeled as ULTRA races. What is an ultra? An ultra marathon is categorized as any distance beyond the 42.2 km mark. These races range in distance between 100km to 500km  with limiting time constraints, variations in terrain and landscape whether that be racing up Mt.Fiji or running through the Sahara deserts. And if that’s not enough; we are expected to carry our own food and water supply along with whatever essentials you can manage to fit on your back all the way to the finish line. 
I am sure after reading through the second paragraph, you are now wondering, what can you do for a humble ultra runner like me? Help me with local recognition as a Canadian representative attempting to reach a national and eventually international audience who will then assist in putting Canada on the global athletic map. This generous donation will ensure the jumpstart to my upcoming year long mission to paint the global platform red and white.

Une équipe engagée !
Imaginez que tous les enfants puissent vivre une expérience positive dans le sport et que leur entourage soit source d’inspiration pour de saines habitudes de vie !
C’est dans cet espoir que chaque membre de l’équipe «Osez le 1000 km» de la commission scolaire des affluents s’engage à être ambassadeur de saines habitudes de vie.
Cette année, l’une des principales motivations de l’équipe est de stimuler la santé psychologique à l’école. Nous croyons fermement que les sentiments de compétence et d’appartenance sont la base d’une bonne estime de soi et de la réussite scolaire.
Nous parrainons deux écoles primaires issues de milieux différents. L’une dans la région de l’Assomption et l’autre à Mascouche où l’on y retrouve une clientèle en soutien émotif. Notre engagement est lié à permettre aux enfants de ces établissements, de participer à une variété d’activités qui leur permettront de :
·       découvrir leurs intérêts;
·       d’identifier leurs forces;
·       d’être à la recherche de solutions;
·       d’éviter de juger, mais plutôt encourager;
·       de développer des relations positives;
·       de veiller à leur bien-être psychologique et physique.
 Nous avons besoin de votre encouragement financier afin de mener à terme nos objectifs
Ces jeunes sont la relève des athlètes d’aujourd’hui, soyez généreux afin de former des enfants qui sont physiquement actifs et psychologiquement en santé. Ils apprendront mieux et sauront mieux s’adapter en tant qu’adultes.

Isabella Balatka. I am 14 years old. I was recently offered the opportunity of a lifetime, the chance to represent the United States as a member of the U15 U.S. Youth National Futsal team. We will travel to Barcelona this winter. To help cover the expenses, I am asking for your help.
Like many other girls my age, I play soccer. I am part of G2004 Black Temecula United soccer team, a team that is in Flight 1 of the Southern California Developmental Soccer League. These past few years, I have developed a passion for the beautiful game. I have since made it an objective to train hard, in order to reach the top. With most of my family originating from Brazil, I was soon introduced to a sport similar to soccer, called futsal. Futsal is a very popular sport in Brazil. It is played on flat ground, typically on hardwood floors. The court is considerably smaller than a soccer field, and the ball is heavier. With limited space, futsal helps players improve dribbling in tight spaces, and make quicker decisions. Many of the greatest soccer players began by playing futsal, and this helped them stand out, being faster and more skillful than their competition.
When my family and I moved to California two years ago, we were fortunate enough to find a futsal club near our home. Since then, I have been training there regularly, hoping to bring my game to the next level. As the months went by, I have noticed significant improvement in my skills, and the results were showing as the number of goals and assists I created increased. With the help of my coaches, I began to stand out as a player. I soon discovered of a tryout I could go to in order to become part of the National Futsal Team. In the beginning of May, I attended a Regional Futsal ID camp in San Diego, the first step of the player selection process. I performed well at the camp, and was then sent to the National ID camp in Kansas City, KS in June. In Kansas, I was ranked among the top twelve players of my age group, and was offered a spot on the team.
The U.S. Youth National Futsal Team is scheduled to visit Barcelona in December, and will play several matches against the best teams of Spain. It would be an absolute dream come true to be able to represent my country, playing the sport I love.
This is an incredible chance to play futsal at the highest level, and learn a tremendous amount of futsal. It would expose me to the best coaches, and would continue to help me improve my soccer abilities, helping me continue to approach my ultimate goal, playing soccer professionally. To help me realize this dream, please support my campaign. All the money donated will go toward helping pay for part of the expenses for my trip to Spain.
Besides donating, you can also participate by purchasing any of the clothing items in our online store: GirlSoccerPro.com

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story. It would be great to receive support in the form of a donation. However, if donating is not for you, please share my story with others, especially those who love soccer/futsal. I really appreciate all the help.

He one day wants to become a Black Belt. But like Katelyn, his goal is to continue on the path of competing locally, regionally and nationally.
The Journey Of A Competitor
Though it sounds great that these great competitors win National Titles and look to make a name for themselves... it doesn't come with out sacrifice! They train 4-5 days a week with training sessions lasting about 3 hours at a time. They also have a strength and conditioning coach. This takes a lot of time and dedication to master their crafts.
Not only do they basically live in the gym, they also attend training clinics to improve their skills. This helps them grow in their sport.
What some people don't realize is that even though they spend hours upon hours of training, there's not always National or Huge Tournaments happening. And... for them to keep their skills up, they compete at local and regional tournaments quite often. This is where things become expensive, especially since most competitions are 3-5 hours from their homes. Traveling and logdging costs start compounding the $60-100 competition entry fees. And... Some competitions require you to be a member of a specific organization, like the United States Judo Federation, the United States Jujitsu Federation, and/or the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), etc... And those fees are annual at about $50 per registration. All 3 of our members have 5-6 different organizations they must keep current an active.

My name is Sam Smith I'm 16 years old and I row for Taunton Rowing Club.
Taunton rowing club row in the heart of Taunton town centre on the river tone. We formed in 2012 but before we were originally Wimbleball Rowing Club. We are based in firepool car park just opposite Viridor.
As we are a very small club of only 50 members so funding is hard!
The boat I row in at the moment is a swift racing boat which is for someone who weighs 85-110kg. It isn't right for me at all as I only weight 76kg so I am extremely over boated. The swift is the only decent 'race worthy' single scull at the club that isn't privately owned.
I started rowing in 2013 because they needed member so my sister got me to join. I fell in love with the sport as soon as I sat in the boat for the first time. I find myself loving it more and more each day. What I love about the sport is the adrenalin rush when racing down the course with your fellow members, family and friends shouting you on. My biggest Strength is determination because I never give up! When I'm not winning a race I will make sure I do anything and everything to get into first place. Sometimes this has an effect as I've previously fainted or been sick after races due to pushing myself so hard.  
my first event was in May 2014 at Monmouth rowing club which i won the J15 single. My success has grown and grown since them.

Last season was my first 'full' racing season. The competitions I have won since May 2014 are
Monmouth regatta 2014- J15 single
Wimbleball regatta 2014- J15 single
Wimbleball regatta 2014- J15 mixed double
Dart Totnes regatta 2014- men's novice single
Gloucester regatta 2014- J17 double
Monmouth head- IM3 double
Cardiff head 2015- J16 single
Monmmouth regatta 2015- J16 single (Saturday 23rd may)
Monmouth regatta 2015- J18 double
Monmouth regatta 2015- J16 double (Sunday 24th may)
Wimbleball regatta 2015- J16 single (2nd/8)
Exeter regatta 2015- J16 single (2nd/8)
Totnes regatta 2015- IM3 single (2nd/12)
Totnes regatta 2015- J16 single (2nd/12)

With my newly purchased boat the list will just keep getting bigger and bigger.

Next season I am competing at all those events including national schools and national championships. Also I will be trialling for GB juniors. I am currently in training 10-12 times a week on and off the water for these events as the competition is so high. Yes it is hard but I am very determined at what I do. If I have a goal I will stick by it until I achieve it.

The boat I will be buying is a reverse wing rigger wintech international single scull or a reverse wing phoenix racing boat.
Wintech and phoenix racing boats are beautiful! They are light, fast and VERY robust.
If you're willing to donate/sponsor I will be so happy! As it will help me to achieve my goal with a national title and hopefully a GB junior acceptant.

NPTHC is a small non-profit club teaching the Korean martial arts of Taekwondo and Hapkido. NPTHC is an official member of World Taekwondo (worlds largest martial art organization), the World Kido Federation and Hanminjok Hapkido.
In September 2018 after a stunning display of patterns and fighting at the Oceania Hapkido Championships eight competitors, and one coach, from NPTHC were selected to join the New Zealand Hapkido Team to compete against over 3000 athletes from around the world. This is a chance of a life time for all those selected.
New Zealand Hapkido being a amateur sporting organisation with no available funds is unable to help financially with the team, so most of it will be self-funded. Each competitor and the coach have to come up with a minimum of $6000nz to cover the expenses such as the official Itinerary, competitions, seminars, accommodation, flights etc..
Any funds raised will be used to support (financially) only those competitors, and coach,who are going. The funds will be divided equally.

Sickles High School Football is working to get top athletes the tools they need in order to be successful. The process is long, it takes patience, perseverance, and a very dedicated athlete and organization to make it happen. Sickles Football has 98 athletes and 14 coaches and support staff working together to get ready for the season. We have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! To help us reach our goals in representing Tampa, FL on the state stage, fight for district and state championships, and have the means to do so.
The average cost of a season for a top athlete is approximately $350.00, and that doesn't include actual equipment needs. Athletes are responsible for covering expenses to attend all the necessary training camps, train year-round, competition entry fees, team meals, and equipment, amongst other things.
We are fighting an uphill battle. Since the beginning of the year, we have had to raise to pay for new uniforms which the school did not have. We have updated our practice equipment, uniforms, field equipment, technology, Hudl account, and much more. We had an unexpected expenditure due to our headsets breaking down last Friday night. This is a HIGH priority item in order to put our athletes in the best situations to be successful. We have to make efforts to replace this system.   
By contributing, you are supporting Sickles High School Football as an organization and its athletes. You are also becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, that is helping young athletes reach their dreams and achieve athletic excellence. Being a part of Sickles Football is a big step forward in an athlete's development, and we believe we can take them to the next level.
We are asking for your support and to help spread the word! Please team up with us!",6.0,0.0,3.0,12.0,2.0,16.0

I vårt landslag spelar döva och hörselskadade spelare som har en hörselförlust på minst 55 decibel per öra.
Vi lyckades fjol kvala in oss till ett historiskt Världsmästerskap som kommer att pågå mellan 19 juni-3 juli i Salerno, Italien.
Fotbollsverksamheten omstrukturerades för tre år sen och vi påbörjade då en stor satsning på verksamheten, bland annat anställde vi en välmeriterad tränare i Conny Bååth som tidigare varit tränare för bland annat Assyriska. Vid Conny har vi också assisterade tränaren Adrian Whale som bland annat jobbat för storklubben Arsenal.
Satsningen har alltså gett resultat där vi överraskande lyckades kvalificera oss till kvartsfinalen under förra sommarens Europamästerskap där det tog slut för oss efter en förlust mot Storbritannien. Man inkluderade sen också kvalificering till Världsmästerskapet i Euorpamästerskapet vilket vi också lyckades med.
Vi har också gjort en sammanfattning av vår insats i Europamästerskapet 2015 genom vår anspråkslösa EM-Krönika här som också ligger ute på youtube. Den är berättad på båda teckenspråk och tal där textning också finns.

Vi förbereder nu oss för Världsmästerskapet, ett mästerskap som är populärt. Vi räknar med tiotusentals publik från alla länder i världen, mästerskapet kommer att livesändas och medierepresentanter kommer att vara på plats för att rapportera om mästerskapet.
Vi, Dövlandslaget i fotboll, ber här om stöttning till vår VM-resa. Då vi inte har så stora inkomster i form av anslag och sponsorer blir spelarna tvungna att spendera stora utgifter själva för att få delta i mästerskapet. Med Er hjälp, stora som små, kan vi se till att spelarna får reducerade utgifter.

I am Norell, A player for the KESW Under 16's Hockey Team - We are going on tour!
The King Edward's Witley U16's hockey team have fired up another tour to a new location. This years location is Cork, Ireland. This trip is to not only play hockey against another country's team and see how different tactics and skill level is but to also show these pupils the culture of Ireland.

Thankfully enough money had been raised to arrange the travel and accommodation for the team but we still require a few more items. The money raised here would go towards new kits, hockey sticks and mouth guards for the team as they go away to somewhat represent England against these neighbouring countries

A whole mix of pupils will be coming on the trip with many different backgrounds - for some people it'll be their first time out of the country so we would like to make this a memorable trip and exciting experience with introduction to new culture and ways of living.

A link will be attached with the school website and all money raised would be greatly welcome. Any overflowing money would then be donated towards charities like spring board, allowing kids opportunities like going to these places more often.

Kind regards,

We are the girls you see in the picture. A year ago we played Futsal in a sports club not far from where we all live. Futsal is our greatest passion, also because it has made us what we are now: a family. The problem is that the sports club did nothing but steal money from sponsors we had found here in the area so we decided not to play with them anymore. We would like to be part of a c5 company that was born recently which asked us for money to enter, but we do not have all that money so we went looking for sponsors but have already sponsored other sports clubs or they refuse.
This is our last hope, you are our last hope.
There are other companies in the whole region but it is the only female team in our valley, we should move at least 60 kilometers every time we train and it is not very easy especially because many of us work the next day and the workouts on average are 2 or 3 per week for two hours each.
If you also know what it means to have a passion and want to cultivate it with all your heart, give us something.
If we can earn something and then enter the company and continue our little dream and then have the opportunity to grow, we will update the instagram account we created with images that represent all our happiness and videos of us having fun playing Fustal: @castelivanoc5femmes (the instagram account).

My name is Hanna Karlsson and Im reaching out to you to help me reach my dream - going to the 2019 Crossfit Games in August!
I worked hard and saved up some money and quit my job as a nurse 6 months ago to do what I love - train full time and train hard every day to get my dream. I live and train with my boyfriend Simon Mäntylä. We train and push each other every day to become better athletes.
I've been a athlete in some sort of sport since I was 5 years old. I am currently ranked as one of the fittest women in Sweden in CrossFit. I qualified this year to the the Crossfit Games ( world championship in functional fitness ). So my main goal this year are to go to U.S.A in August to compete at the Games and show myself that I belong with the best by competing against the best.
My journey of being a CrossFit athlete has already taught me so much about myself, but most importantly helped me find myself. When I am doing CrossFit I feel that I can bee 100% me.
 I have been to several international competitions and competed against some bad ass girls. I have been doing this sport for 3 years but have dedicated my heart to it since day one. Before I quit my job I worked out before or after my day, evening or night shifts to get my training in. I tried to get my 2 session in every day but its was not always possible. Today I train 2-3 session & giving 100% every session. Every day I can train full time is a dream for me.
The thing is, Its not free to go to the CrossFit Games. If you don´t have incredible sponsors you need help and that why Im reaching out to you guys.
To be able to reach my goals this year, the CrossFit Games, I have to pay this:
Flight to U.S.A: 2000 EUR
Accommodation: 3000 EUR
Training and food expenses: 3000 EUR
Registration and tickets: 600 EUR
This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my fees. By contributing, you will help me reach my goals but you will also take part in my journey of becoming the happiest girl on the planet. This is MY DREAM and my passion.
I have created some services here on Sportfunder in return for your donation but you can also donate an amount of your own choice if you want.

THANK YOU for the bottom of my heart!

My name is Georgia Blaikie from Stafford, England and started skiing pretty much as soon as I could walk albeit recreationally with my family. My first race experience was a fun race at Tamworth Snowdome at the age of 4 and since then have continued to race internationally in major championships, in February 2022 attended the English Championships in Bormio where I achieved a top 10 position from nearly 50 racers in my age group.  In March 2022 I achieved a podium 2nd place position in the Scottish Ski Championships in Cairngorm.
I train with Midlands Ski Club weekly and also where possible with the Excel Race Academy both in the UK and throughout Europe.
I also represent my school Stafford Grammar where I have been integral to winning the British Schoolgirls Indoor championships in September 2021 (fastest U14 racer and 4th overall).  I also led our team to the English Schools Ski finals in Norwich where I was the fastest Under 14 racer. This year I was the 2nd fastest female overall in the same event, competing against the best in the country up to and including Year 13 racers.
Making progress in my ski racing to be able to compete at the highest level possible is one of my key goals and become one of the best athletes in my sport.  I am already lucky enough to have been selected for both the English Schools Ski Squad and the National Schools Ski Team which presents the opportunity to train in Italy and Norway.  I have also just been selected to ski for England as part of the Under 16 team in the ISF Winter Games in north-eastern Turkey!
Due to COVID-19 I missed the majority of the Under 14 season and now need the opportunity to train in ski resorts to catch up with my European counterparts who have been able to train when we couldn’t travel.
The road to success in skiing is costly with no help provided from any pathways or national funding. The typical cost of training each year (excluding any equipment, travel, and race fees) is approximately £15,000.  Whilst my parents fund me as much as they can to achieve my dream and represent my country, they can only do so much however with your financial help and support and my dedication and commitment I am convinced that you can help me achieve my dream!
You're changing my life. Thank you for your support!

Hello!

We are 18 girls part of the NEPTUNE-SYNCHRO club in Quebec, specifically from St-Jérôme in the Laurentian region. Among our group, 9 girls are part of the Elite team 13-15 and the other 9 are part of the Elite team 16-18. We have competitions across Canada. One of them will take place from March 22 to March 28, 2015 in Victoria, British Columbia.

For each of us, this competition represents an opportunity to be seen at the national level. This is especially important since it will only be the second year for Neptune Synchro to take part in the QUALIFIER. Our goal is to be in the top 10 teams in Canada in both categories. The competition is fierce! But we are very determined!

This fundraiser campaign will allow us to travel to Victoria at a lower cost since the total cost per athlete now is about $ 2,500.
I will be using the funds for:
Here is a glimpse of the expenses associated to the Canadian Qualifier Championships:

-First and foremost, airfare to Vancouver. This represents 975$ per athlete.

-Next, we need to rent 4 minivans ($311 each) as well as pay for ferry fees and gasoline. The reason we have chosen to land in Vancouver and use the ferry rather than simply land in
Victoria is simple…we were able to save 300$ per person on airfare!

-The girls will be lodged 4 per room at a rate of $109 plus taxes per night for 8 days.

-We will need to feed our athletes 3 nutritious meals a day as well as snacks for the entire period.

-Registration fees

-Expenses for our 2 coaches

As you can see, the total cost of this competition is quite steep. Your support would be greatly appreciated and would tremendously help our young athletes along their journey.

We not only rely on donations, we are also quite active in our own fundraising campaigns! Since the beginning of the season, several events were coordinated to help raise funds. Pizzathons, product sales such as cheese and biodegradable household goods were a great success.

My name is Matteo Subet and I’m 19-year-old native of Aosta, where at the age of 2years I put for the first time on skis.
I attended until the age of 10 years old competitive course at the Ski Club Chamole in Pila (Gressan, AO), but the dream of chasingup to participate in a high-level competitionhas unfortunately ended after a serious accident during a workout, so I had to give up my great passion, which led me even to amove away from my hometown.
I later moved to Genoa, where I attended the first part of my schooling until arriving in Eastern Liguria, precisely in Sestri Levante(GE), where I attended high school.
In 2017 I started University career andsubscribing to the course of Product Design and communications.
During this my new experience, I looked out to the world of CUS, Centre for University Sports, which allowed me to resume gradually to chase and pursue my dream: after a period of training to recover form and in part,unfortunately, even the skills lost, I decided toapply at the CUS, detachment of Genoa, astheir representative for the winter for skiing,in official competitions that will take part.
There was the approval of President and administrative guidance to my candidacy and what did well the first official engagement incompetition envisaged by 25 to 28 March this year, where I will be competing at the skiCivetta Ski District which is part of the Dolomiti Superski area, in the province of Belluno.
The round will be divided into two racesdivided by specialty: Giant Slalom and Slalom.
At this event there will be athletes from allover Italy and Europe as it is a competitionunder aegis of FIS, Italian Ski Federation.
In addition to this 4-days when I'll beconstantly present on the plants of the areaof Belluno, frequently I will train at Pila in theSky (Gressan, AO).

Hopeful that you can help me in completing my adventure in the best possible way which will run for 5 seasons and confident in your feedback, thank you for your time and I wish you a good day!",2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,5.0

My name is Ian Morgan (A Kiwi based in Chile) and my partners name is Fran Gonzalez (Chilean).  
We are currently launching an exciting new project to encourage people of any age to be more active, live a healthy lifestyle, and challenge themselves. 
The Hi Five Project came about after a few late night chats, discussing how we can help others, and to show that it’s never to late to set a goal, and follow your dreams. 
We both share a passion for running ultra distance events in some of the worlds wildest places. So to celebrate our 5 years of trail running, we made a commitment in 2019 to run 5 races from the Ultra Trail World Tour in 5 different countries, We are both middle aged ( I am 48 and Fran is 52), however this has not slowed us down or limited us. And we’re always pushing ourselves to take on bigger and bolder challenges
We’re raising funds to help us cover airfares and accomodation as we are not fully sponsored athletes.  
We have developed a great social media following, and have good engagement with our followers. Go check out or Instagram for more info about who we are (@ian.morgan and @frangibar)
And If you require clarification on anything, or would like to discuss further, please feel free to contact us.

My journey of being a dance artist has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I have been to National Hip Hop Dance Champ and Collegiate & Universities Dance Competitions, where I learned so much more about my sport. To become a world-class dancer I had to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way onto a podium.
""Some people underestimate dancers, we put hours and hours in at the studio, we deal with injuries and keep going, we deal with being yelled at for corrections, we tear ourselves apart, for what?
for that one moment we get to shine on stage for that 3 minutes that we show people what we love to do.. for the feeling we get from dancing on a stage dancers work just as hard as any other athlete would. People don't see what happens behind the scenes, they only see the final performance which we make look perfectly and easy.
If you saw what happens behind the scenes maybe you would understand how much we go through just to be able to do what we love."" -anonymous
To be able to reach these goals this year I have to pay $1500. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my fees. By contributing you will help me reach my goals but you will also take part in our journey of becoming a gold medalist.

Sincerely,
Christian Villote
Philippine Delegate to Hip Hop International, USA

Mi Historia

A los 13 años conocí el deporte del Bodyboarding. En este deporte encontré la unión de dos cosas que amo: el deporte y la naturaleza. Desde entonces el bodyboarding se convirtió en mi pasión. El bodyboarding me ha dado un propósito, me ha regalado la alegría de representar a mi país y de servir a muchas comunidades alrededor del mundo. Gracias por leer mi historia, tomarme en consideración y hacer de este sueño uno compartido.


Reconocimientos

Por los pasados 6 años hemos logrado que Puerto Rico esté en los primeros puestos del ranking mundial del Bodyboarding. Actualmente ocupo el 8vo. lugar del circuito mundial (APB). Como parte de nuestra trayectoria, en el 2009 logramos traerle a Puerto Rico el campeonato del prestigioso evento Pipeline Master (Hawaii). Luego, en el 2013, me convertí en la primera mujer en ganar la competencia Arica Challenge - Chile, también obtuve medalla de plata en los Juegos Mundiales (ISA) en Venezuela y un año después logramos el campeonato del Circuito Latinoamericano en Ecuador. En abril 2019 obtuvimos el Campeonato Nacional de Puerto Rico (logrado en múltiples ocasiones). Con tu apoyo económico lograré traerle grandes noticias a Puerto Rico.  


Mi amor y compromiso con las comunidades

Como atleta, vivo convencida de que parte de mi misión es dejar un legado en nuestras comunidades. Es por esto que tan pronto logré cumplir en el 2009 el sueño de ganar Pipeline (Hawaii), decidí organizar junto a un grupo de voluntarios un evento de transformación social para la comunidad que me enseñó a surfear mis primeras olas durante mi adolescencia. Desde entonces, todos los años, realizamos la “Jornada Eco-deportiva” en la comunidad de “La Perla” (San Juan). Este proyecto consiste de talleres educativos y deportivos ofrecidos gratuitamente a niños y jóvenes de la comunidad.

Documental ""Luz en Latinoamérica""

En el 2016 tuvimos la oportunidad de presentar el documental ""Luz en Latinoamérica"". El trabajo cinematográfico que no solo recoge nuestro quehacer deportivo como bodyboarder, sino que también aborda el trabajo educativo y voluntario realizado en diferentes partes de Latinoamérica apoderando niñas y niños a través del deporte. Al igual que este proyecto; hay otros en camino. Llegar a todos los países del circuito mundial también me permitirá  seguir expandiendo nuestra ola de amor y servicio a otras comunidades.

I have always admired the beautiful thoroughbreds. 1200 pounds of lean muscle mass racing down the track was a sight to behold. Horse racing in general I have always enjoyed. While working the backsides of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club as a hot walker, I received encouragement from a few riders to pursue a career in riding. After a bit of troubles, I packed my bags and left San Diego, California for the North American Racing Academy in Lexington, Kentucky.
Kentucky was quite a shock, especially being a native San Diegan. But the shock gave me the focus and determination to get through the program. On January 7th, 2015 I rode my first horse, a thoroughbred no less. From then on, I trained hard, learning everything I could about these majestic beasts. I have surpassed many of the goals I set that year. Life is not without its obstacles though. In February 2015 a fire broke out at my apartment and took with it all my belongings. I was left with nothing but the compassion of good neighbors and my drive to succeed. I overcame the situation fairly quickly and continued with my training. By August I was breezing horses out of the gates and riding two year olds on the track working for other trainers. After a quick trip to Florida to break babies, I eventually made it home to San Diego working for the established trainer Peter Miller. I have been learning more and perfecting my form day by day.
I am grateful for the opportunities that have been presented to me. They have taken me a long way from where I started but I still have much to learn. The passion I have for riding grows with me everyday. I look forward to the 4am mornings at the barn six days a week. Its thought but it is worth it. To all aspiring riders out there, I say this: train, train, train. It's not easy to make it, but remember it's not impossible either.

My name is Maximus Tufugafale and I am from San Diego, CA, USA. I am truly passionate about Baseball, which I exercise as often as I can. My goal is to become one of the best athletes in baseball, and I need your help to turn the impossible into a reality.
I was recently selected to participate in the Baseball Factory's Player Development Program happening this July at Vanguard University. The total cost for the program is $3499. So far, I've paid about $1400 and need a little of help for the next $2099. This program will help me become a better baseball player and help me on my journey to reaching my goal of joining the MLB in the near future.  
Just yesterday, I received an email letting me know that they selected me as 1 of 30 players to join the Baseball Factory's Regional West Team. That means I was selected out of many other great baseball players my age to join this prestigious team. As a member of this team ($299 membership fee), I would have Roundtable Zoom discussions with Danny Evans (former GM of the LA Dodgers), Luis Lopez (former MLB player), and Andy Barkett (Red Sox World Series Championship hitting coach).  I would also be able to join the Regional Team through Zoom video conferences to work with the coach and teammates on a weekly basis; this includes virtual team meetings where I would receive motivational messages, in-home training plans, hitting and pitching approach tips, and group instruction.   
With your help, I would be able to receive very much needed training from better players than myself, which will help me tremendously in reaching my goal of making it to the MLB.  If you could support me by making a donation and then sharing this campaign with your network, I would greatly appreciate it. I know that money can be tight, so please know that even $5 helps me get closer to my goal! Let me know if you have any questions and I’ll be happy to answer them.

Les 39 athlètes et le personnel d'entraineur iront a Orlando en Floride pour livrer la performance de leur vie. Ils se mesureront aux meilleurs équipes du monde.
Cette campagne a pour but de récolter des fonds pour permettre aux membres de ces équipes de Cheerleading de payer le transport et l'hébergement. Ceci afin de leur permettre de s'entrainer sur les lieux de la compétition et ainsi avoir la possibilité d'être prêt le jours de la compétition.
De plus cette campagne permettra aux athlètes de mettre plus de temps à la préparation en sol Québecois. Ils n'auront pas à faire multiples campagne de financement supplémentaire.
D'ici là,  les athlètes pratiquent plusieurs heures semaine dans les installations de Flames Cheerleading. Ils prendront aussi part a deux compétitions au début du mois d'avril. Tout ceci dans le but d'avoir une préparation adéquate.

Les coûts relié a une tel compétition sont très grand pour de jeunes athlètes. Cette campagne aura pour but de payer les frais d'hébergement le transport ainsi que le site d'entrainement sur place.

Voici une idée des coûts pour cette compétition.
Billet d'avion: 470$
Hébergement et centre de pratique:1200$

Ceci s'ajoute aux frais déjà payer pour la saison et les compétitions que les athlètes ont déjà déboursé.

The Betancourt Fencing School (BTC) is working to get its athletes to the top since Guillermo Betancourt first came to Brazil in 1995. He came initially to work for a Brazilian sports club, and later started his own fencing school. He has since trained many international athletes, and still begins the training of new, young athletes, children are a big portion of our athletes, who are inspired by the love, support, and friendship that exists between the members of our group.
Fencing takes patience, perseverance, organization, and a lot of dedication, but also, a functioning room in witch to train in, the problem is that: For a long time, training happened in a building owned by the government.  Unfortunately, in the beggining of this year, it was sold and will soon be demollished. Since our eviction, the only place available was the outdoors in Ibirapuera Park, where we have been training, quite literally, rain or shine.
Six months have past, and we finally found a new place where we will be able to train, the problem now, is that it needs some serious and immediate renovations: the floor has to be levelled off, lights have to be installed, the bathroom has to be fixed, gaps in the walls have to be filled, plumbing has to be fixed, glass has to be put in the window, and lastly the fencing strips have to be installed as well. All of this requires money, just under 11000 dollars worth of renovations, but this is money we just don't have.
To raise this money, we have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! To help us reach our goal in representing not only Brazil, but our incredible coach and our love for this great sport that is fencing. Our main goal is to get close to 10000 dollars off this campaign to help as much as possible with the renovations, but every single penny counts!
By contributing, you are supporting Betancourt Fencing School as an organization and its athletes. You are also becoming part of a big step forward for individual athletes as well as Brazilian fencing as a whole, and we believe we can take it to the next level.
We are asking for your support and to help spread the word! Please team up with us!",15.0,2.0,4.0,25.0,1.0,26.0

This team of female kickboxers have been raising the bar for athleticism in Russellville, Arkansas. They train day in and day out in order to insure their success at IKF.  Their handwork & dedication is inspiring to other men and women in our gym as well as the community.  Asia & McKinley will be attending IKF for the first time this year in hopes of becoming world champions.  Asia is 19 years old and has been training since August.  She is extremely talented and we are excited to watch her grow as a martial artist!  She will be competing in the novice division of her weight class. McKinley is 13 years old and has been doing martial arts since 2012 and her potential is through the roof!  She has competed in a jiu jitsu match at an MMA show and won gold at the 2014 AGF Arkansas State Championship.  This will be her debut in kickboxing and we know she will represent her team well!

Cora & Evelyn will be defending their titles this year in Orlando.  Cora is 22 years old and has been kickboxing since 2012.  She had three fights last year at IKF in order to win her open class championship belt; 1 TKO, 2 unanimous decisions.  In November of 2014, Cora competed in St. Louis against a Team USA, multi-world champion kickboxer and fought to the draw.  There is no doubt she will come back this year with another belt in hand.  Evelyn is 27 years old and has been training kickboxing since 2013.  She has a winning record in both MMA & kickboxing in her short time of training. Last year she brought home the trophy for the novice division at IKF. Evelyn has a contagious work ethic that helps push the team to their best! Both of these ladies have been putting in extra work to ensure their success. Evelyn & Cora will both be fighting in the open class divisions this year.

It's incredible how fast my brother got between the best in the sport just for three years. That's the first time I've seen such dedication!

Up until now the club was managing to provide everything for their members but with the prices going up it is very hard.

My name is Tom Gandy and I come from Port Erin on the Isle of Man. I am a proud Manxman and have grown up on the island, learning to play golf with my dad and my brothers at Rowany Golf Club. After winning the Isle of Man Championship in 2017, I turned Professional and have spent the past two seasons competing on the EuroPro Tour in the UK, qualifying for the end of season Championship in both seasons, and ending 2019 with a run of 4 consecutive Top 10 finishes.

However, the highlight of 2019 was undoubtedly my performance at Qualifying School last month where I missed earning my full European Tour card by a single shot. However, despite this, I still gained Category 22 membership of the European Tour which means I will have the opportunity to compete in approximately 8-10 European Tour events throughout 2020, as well as having full playing privileges on the Challenge Tour, letting me fly the Manx flag all around the globe.

I have been overwhelmed by the support I have received in 2019, especially from the community on the Isle of Man, and lots of people have approached me offering to help. In conjunction with my Management company and some of my sponsors, we have come up with this Crowdfunding idea in the hope that people can get something worthwhile in return for their generosity - and show their support on the golf course with some fantastic quality rewards.

This global opportunity obviously requires greater commitment than competing in the UK. By supporting  me today, hopefully you can feel part of my journey as I look to put the Isle of Man in the golfing map and realise my dream of a guy from Rowany playing alongside such household names as Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods, and Justin Rose.

Thanks.

This year, our varsity team was able to bag the National Championship in the Philippine qualifier of Hip-Hop International, which earned us a slot back on the World Hip-Hop Dance Championship stage this coming August in Las Vegas, Nevada. We'll be representing the Philippines and going up against crews from over 50 other countries in hopes of becoming World Champions. This will be our third time to represent the country in this competition, having finished 26th overall the first time and 11th overall last year. 
We have strong faith in our 8-man varsity team that will be flying out this year and we believe that it is very possible for us to surpass the accomplishments we've had from the previous years. With that, we would like to ask for your generous love and support as we represent the dance community, our family and friends, our team and most importantly our country in this endeavor. Our team has been working hard, balancing academics with rehearsals day in and day out to reach their dream stage and it would be a huge aid and blessing to our kids if you were able to help us with our expenses for travel, accommodation, food and transportation fees to name a few. 
In advance, we'd like to express our gratitude to anyone and everyone who will be helping us out. It will mean the world to our kids that there are people who believe in their dreams and help them reach it.

For the 8 of us embarking on this journey, it will be the trip of a lifetime. We are truly honored to be able to do what we love best while representing our homeland! For most of us, dance has been a central part of our lives since we started walking. Dancing on the world stage will be the dream come true.  As dancers, we are at the studio for countless hours training hard to become the best dancers we can be.

       We would like to raise money as a team so that standing on the podium while wearing our Team Canada jackets and singing our National Anthem will be within reach. The trip to Poland is expensive and unfortunately, as the government does not consider dance to be a sport, we do not receive any funding. It is up to us to raise all the money we can to help us get to our training practices in Toronto, and pay our way to Poland.

       The cost for each dancer to be able to compete at the World Championship is approximately $4000. Raising enough money to bring us one step closer to our dream would be immensely appreciated. The money raised will be used to cover travel expenses, accommodation, team wear (jackets and costumes), and competition fees.

       The International Dance Organization (IDO) is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).  We are eager to represent Canada at the International level. Gold is what we are aiming for and with your help, it is more likely to be achieved!

We were unable to participate last year due to financial issues, and have held several fundraisers since the beginning of the season, but we are still falling short of our goal. The competition we wish to take part in is a 7s tournament that has taken place in New York for 50 years, and counting. More than 100 teams from the States, Canada, and around the world participated in the tournament last year.


With this campaign, we hope to raise enough money to make it to the New York Sevens Tournament and to develop ourselves as players by playing against high caliber rugby teams.

After read book Ultramarathon man form Dean Karnazes, we decide to try train harder and run 50 kilometers threw the nature, not the city like we used to. But the problem is that neither one of us ever run a longer distance than 21 kilometers. We think it´s a good challenge and we want to make a short documentary video about our training and the attempt to this run.We need some money for stuff to make our challenge, like a GoPro for making a video from our run or good runners clothes, because we will do it in winter and maybe on our track will be a snow. Also need some sporttester for both of us, which help to train with better effectivity and some special food. Our goal is 300$ to make a short documentary video,1000$ to make a short documentary movie and 3000$ to make a online stream transmission on web pages.. 
If our project will be funded, it can help not only us, but also other people. Our documentary can motivate people to really do something. We know many people which have an unhealthy life style, eat junk food and can´t run 50 meters to bus. We want to show people, that if you want a you are strong and good motivated, you can beat any challenge you want. Limits is in your mind.Other Ways You Can HelpYou can share our project on social sites for help. Thank you all guys.
Good luck!",6.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,5.0

Through sport, formation sessions and cultural activities, we promote the spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair-play, teaching teamwork, self-discipline, respect for others, and leadership.The Banzaï Volleyball club was founded on May 19, 1996. The sport association “Banzaï” is part of the Mamosa-Cunina foundation. On September 5 of the same year, the club was officially affiliated with the Haitian Federation of Volleyball (FHVB) and with the League of Volleyball of the West (LVBRO). « Banzai » was a Japanese battle cry during the war and is literally translated as « Ten Thousand Years ». The Japanese warriors honored the emperor by shouting « Banzaï », meaning, « Long live the Emperor ». Banzai is a term derived from the Japanese samurai spirit and ideology of not accepting the shame of defeat. From a small foundation, the Banzai club became a well-known sport association in Haiti. But aware of the financial demands of the club, we worry about its future. Most members of the club are students from lower income families. These are young students who, in spite of poverty, hope for a better life, hope for a better future. The club needs financial help and support for the advancement of its mission and vision. Major expenses cover the purchase of equipment for training sessions and competitions; uniforms; compensations for trainers; the cost of organizing and expenses on the annual summer camp. Other expenses would include transportation and training expenses. Banzaï club has been very successful because of so many generous individuals who believe that through sport, we can make a difference in the life of many young Haitian men and women. Haiti is in need of hope and we are planting this hope for the future with these young men and women who express their desire and passion to life through sport.
The average cost of a season for a top athlete is approximately 300 $, and that doesn't including living expenses.

I am raising funds to be able to do a number of things for a newly formed field hockey club in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. One is to purchase hockey equipment, and the other is to build up the club and it's members and players.
So far, the club has managed to affiliate and purchase uniforms through kind donations of individual club members. We have a good number of individuals who have decided to try out the sport for the first time and this excites us as being able to promote the code.
Field Hockey in PNG is managed and played by individuals who commit and dedicate their personal time and resources voluntarily. One of our main goals as a new club is to offer our players and members an experience unmatched, while being part of the club. By building this club into a brand that changes the game, the mindset and the attitude towards sports in general. Especially in a time like this, for a country like ours, we need something good to look forward to that can also build capacity for each and everyone involved.
Every dollar would be well appreciated! Thanks for your time and believing in being the change you want to see! :)

I am the Sports Director of the Laguna Madre Youth Center, an afterschool and summer program for disadvantaged youth in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. We serve high-risk children ages 6 to 18, and offer a wide variety of sports programs; soccer and basketball leagues for the kids. We currently have 100 daily members, and a basketball league for another 100 kids. In addition, we offer our gym to the Capable Kids Foundation of the Lower Valley, many of these kids being wheelchair bound;and to several teenage teams for practice in the evenings.
My campaign goals:
The Center was founded in 1989. The building we are housed in was built in 1996. After 22 years, our gym floor has tears, gouges, and holes all over, and it has become a major safety issue for our players. We need to tear out the original 60' x 96' floor and replace it with a new, safe floor. Sadly, we are a non-profit organization, and do not have funds available to do so.
The LMYC supports all of our programs through grants, corporate and individual contributions, and fundraisers. Our Board of Directors work tirelessly to raise funds for our organization. However, the local community has a very high poverty rate, and can only help so much. We charge each member minimal monthly membership fees, and offer scholarships to those whose families cannot afford to pay.
Our Mission is ""to provide a safe place for children to go after school where they will receive healthy meals, help with learning skills, participate in sports and recreation, interact in positive ways, and learn to be responsible members of the community."" It is becoming very difficult to fulfill the ""safe place"" when our gym floor is so decrepit! And, in addition to basketball, we have programs in fitness, indoor soccer, cheerleading, and other sports. All require a safe gym floor.  

I'm raising funds for a new gym floor because:
The Laguna Madre Youth Center has had several quotes for this project. It is estimated that we will need close to $50,000 to complete the work needed. With your help we will be that much closer to our goal, and will soon be able to provide a safe play environment once again.
Why I need your support:
We can't do this project alone.  We need your help!  Please help us to reach our goal and help all of the children who use our facility.  Please donate $50, $100, $250, $500, or even $1,000 today! Every bit helps, and is so appreciated! And don't forget to share our campaign, too. There are many different ways to help us reach our goals – contributing, sharing our campaign with the MAKEACHAMP tools, contacting the media, and asking them to follow our progress even after our campaign ends.
Thank you for putting smiles on our children's faces! We are so thankful to have your support.",18.0,2.0,8.0,31.0,5.0,18.0

We really want to go and represent our district and improve on our rankings from last season, especially now that we did so well in the TNL competition.

Currently I am living in Poland for 4 years, and I love this country very much as this country gave me a passion, it is a place where I started my adventure with armwrestling.
Armwrestling it is so difficult sport where you have to pass through a lot of injuries and sometimes to train through pain in elbows and a lot of injuries.
 I decided to become a World Champion in armwrestling in order to become the best and change my life and live better. I had to work and study at the same time as I was emigrant from Ukraine and education was esxpensive but every time I dreamed about armwrestling.
After 2 years of training I competed on Polish National Championship , where I achived 2-nd and 3-rd place among Juniors 21 years in the 70kg category.
The worst thing to achieve you dream is lack of money, as this sport only starts to grow in Poland, and there is no money from country or city.
Only some of the counrties pay scholarships, and only the best armwrestlers in the World are able to earn money for their lives.
Every expenses on your own cost, trip to the competition, equipment, licenses, accomodation even clothing. Preparation takes a lot of money and after winning the competition you can only get medal and dyploma.
I organized little Gym in my basement in order to train and cut expensies, I dream to re-build this place, buy proffesional equipment and give an opportunity to train for young athletes as I am for free, opportunity which i have never had.
I dream to become the best one and to be able to live from my armwrestling activity and  to help others not to lose enthusiasm for sport because of luck of money
Hope you will help me to achieve this dream, and make hard reality of our lives a little bit softer",16.0,2.0,3.0,18.0,3.0,12.0

Jablkowski Sailing Team is one of the fastest-progressing sailing teams in the world. During only three seasons it advanced from 1112th to 20th place in World Sailing Match Racing rankings.
We take part in the sailing competitions of the Match Racing World Cup, Polish Sailing Premier League and this year will make our debut in the Sailing Champions League. During three years we have evolved from sailing with friends to one of the most promising teams in the world.
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
Today's world-class sailing requires not only hard training, but also significant budgets. We've gone as far we could on our own. Despite our best efforts, we haven't been able to find enough commercial sponsorship. This is why we decided to reach out to passionate and generous people all over the world and ask for support. Our dream is to win the match racing world championship and take part in the America's Cup. We know we can do it with your help!
We'll be very grateful for every donation you make to support our dream.

My name is Hock Eng and I am from Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. I am truly passionate about Diabolo, which I practice as often as I can. My goal is to become one of the best athletes in my sport, and I need your help to turn the impossible into a reality.
Recently I participated at the International Diabolo Competition held in Osaka, Japan. It was my first time going overseas to participate in competitions. I managed to win fourth place in one of the division that I joined.
There will be another International competition in January 2020, in Shizuoka Japan. I would also like to participate in this competition.
I am finishing my diploma in graphic design soon, and will continue further for a degree in December 2019. As a student, funds are limited as my father retired three years ago. Below are the estimated expenses for the above competition.
- Flight tickets return tickets from KL to Tokyo = $480
- Local transportation return tickets from Tokyo to Shizuoka = $190
- Accommodation for 5 days = $290
- Food budget 5 days = $240
- Contest registration fees for 3 division = $80
To excel, I need to be constantly push my limits. I am ready to work hard, but at the same time, I know that the road to success will be costly. By supporting me today, you are investing into something bigger than just a fundraiser. You're changing my life. Thank you for your support! :)

""The ocean can not only heal cuts with salt, but it has the ability to trigger a psychological state of calm and contentment. It can literally wash away the pain."" - Adam Royal

The ocean is not only a place for recreation and relaxation, but also a place for healing. It has been proven to heal skin conditions and wounds, helps allergies, and has the same capability of reducing depression and anxiety as antidepressant drugs. It is a great way to cleanse your mind and body and rejuvenate the soul. It gives us a deeper connection and understanding of Mother Nature and all of her glory.

Recently, we have found ourselves in a position that has made us realize what we are truly passionate about; adaptive surfing. The past few months have showed us that that is what is truly important to us and gives us a sense of purpose. A sense of purpose and having a community is key not only for us, but the athletes we hope to assist in the water as well.

What is adaptive surfing?
Adaptive surfing is designed for anyone with a cognitive or physical disability that simply wants to enjoy riding waves and feeling a sense of freedom again. These special abilities may include amputees, spinal cord injuries(paraplegic, quadriplegic), down syndrome, autism, PTSD, blind/vision impaired, deaf, little people, limb deficiency, or any other special ability that require a modification to participate.

 
Together with some of the most passionate souls in the world of adaptive surfing, we will be starting the first ever high performance adaptive surf training center in the heart of surfing in Peru! Punta Hermosa will be home to our camp and we could not be more excited! Within 4 kilometers we have over 10 different surf breaks! Our goal is to have an accessible house for athletes to come stay, surf, and relax. When it comes to adaptive equipment, it is quite costly. A beach wheelchair alone is around $3,000 and an absolute necessity to get these athletes in and out of the water. With the funds we raise we will also purchase insurance, beach mats, wet suits, adapted boards for beginning surfers, life jackets, ramps, handles, grab bars, and anything else to help make the house accessible.

 
We have reached out to athletes and those who are well known for making the sport what it is today to get their input and expert advise. One of our focuses is to get folks into the water that don’t normally have the accessibility or tools to do so. The other is to have adaptive surfers come from all over the world that compete or just simply want to improve their surfing and knowledge.  We will have a photographer/videographer that will be available for video analysis which is key to any surfer’s development; helping identify strengths and weaknesses in techniques, wave riding, and reading the ocean.

With me in this quest is a person with the biggest heart I have ever met, Piero Marotta. He too carries the light and passion for the sport and these athletes. Piero got started with adaptive surfing because of his good friend Pancho Arbulu. Pancho was a pilot, on his way to work when rocks were intentionally placed in the road causing the car to crash and flip. Pancho broke his neck at the C5, C6, and C7 vertebrae which left him a quadriplegic; without the use of his arms or legs.

Since then, they have traveled to Argentina, Chile, Hawaii, California, and Costa Rica to compete against some of the best adaptive surfers in the world. All of this without support or funding. Aside from training every week with Pancho, Piero volunteers with OMAPED, getting people with down syndrome in a pool, teaching them how to swim, hold their breath, and how to be comfortable paddling and balancing on a surfboard.

 

This project means the world to us and we are so excited to bring it to life and get it off the ground! Anything, and we mean ANYTHING helps, even if it is just clicking the share button. Every dollar that is donated gets us one step closer to our goal. If you are unable to donate at this time we would appreciate you sharing our story and vision. You never know how far our story could travel and the lives we could touch. Being in the water builds confidence, self esteem and is extremely therapeutic. Surfing is the ultimate escape and we are hoping to give that stoke to any and everyone while introducing the new adaptive athletes to the veterans. We appreciate each of you for reading this, donating if you can, and sharing our quest.

My journey of being a baseball player has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I have been to numerous tournaments, played on several travel teams and even traveled out of state a time or two for my love of the game. That diamond and my amazing coaches is where I learned so much more about my sport. To become a world-class athlete I had to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way onto a MLB team.
To be able to reach these goals this year I have to pay $3000. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my fees. By contributing you will help me reach my goals but you will also take part in our journey of becoming a All American. The Details of I will be experiencing is below:

For most of the She-Devils, the club becomes a family away from home. It is these ladies that make Beijing life so great – we train, we play, we laugh, we party, we play and then we party some more.  Our main games take place locally, and with an increase in team members over the last 4 years, we have moved from playing 7s to 10s.  We also love to travel to national tournaments to show off our skills at least once per season.
And here, the crowdfunding comes into play: travelling to these tournaments is quite expensive and the club can only support one tournament per season. We are still very keen to play the Beach Rugby Tournament in Qingdao on the 25th of August to get some precious game time before our season starts in September. Therefore, we need to cover the tournament fee (300 ¥/player), train tickets (600¥/player) and accommodation (400 ¥/player) by ourselves. With an amazing number of 14 She-Devils travelling to Qingdao, we need a total of 18,200¥, around 2,300€. Please help us and donate!

We are currently ranked B3 in soccer/football by our national football federation. Our main goals this year are: to be in the top 2 in the region at the end of the season hence be promoted to a higher level.
Our journey of being footballers has taught us so much about ourselves as individuals and as a team, such as our strengths and weaknesses, and how hard we can push ourselves physically and mentally. We have been to the national B-Division championships , where w learned so much more about our sport. To become a B-Class team we had to push our limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, we want more, we know we can do more. We are ready to push our limits even further as we know that we can walk  our way onto a podium.
To be able to reach these goals this year we have to pay for training, recreation and game equipment. This is why we need your support. All donations will directly help us fund our equipment.

My name is Amanda Dennis and I am from Peachtree City, GA, USA. I am truly passionate about Goalball. If you don't know me or my sport let me take you along my journey. Sport became available for me when I was really young. I started playing soccer through organizations in Peachtree City but found out shortly that sport was going to be really hard for me due to my visual impairment. At that point, I felt defeated and never wanted to play a sport or touch a ball again until I was about 7. 
At 7 years old, I was able to attend a sports education camp for athletes who had a visual impairment. This camp taught you how to adapt to sports so that you can be included in mainstream sports, and I also learned about Paralympic sports from the previous Paralympian who competed in The 2000 Sydney games & 2004 Athens Paralympics. 
At 7 years old, I≠ was dreaming of making Team USA and putting on the stars and stripes of our nation. I made my first U19 team at 15 in 2011 and was invited to a National Team Camp. i was DREAMING and working to make my first paralympic debut in Rio 2016 and instead, i was selected to compete in 2012 at The London Paralympics. I gained a lot of experience playing with one of the MOST DECORATED women's goalball teams in Paralympic History, but it wasn't until 2016 where i earned my first Paralympic Medal. A bronze medal meant so much to me, but my journey to Tokyo has been unmatched, these were the games I highlighted for gold, and I will do everything here to help my team achieve it. By the time I reach LA in 2028, I would like to stand tall with three Gold medals. 
It was at this camp that I completely fell in love with the sport of goalball. Goalball is a sport for athletes who are legally blind 20/200 or less. the objective of the game is to throw a 3lbs ball that has bells embedded inside past opponents on the other end into the net. This sounds easy, right? but there's a whole new level when athletes are all blindfolded to create an equal playing field for everyone involved. That means you are laterally moving side to side and hearing a ball going 40+ miles an hour. It's a fast-paced and fantastic game. 

I'm so thankful I have had such a supportive community in Peachtree City growing up, and I'm proud to call it my home! For those of you who don't know, Paralympics is finally getting primetime coverage and publicity, which means my sport is finally in the spotlight. In previous games, my sport got no coverage, which means who had no support either. Paralympics is still a huge step behind Paralympics in terms of how athletes get funded, training expenses, etc. 

Please be a part of my journey and support me towards my goal of reaching the top of the podium, not only in Tokyo but Paris 2028 and on my home court at the Paralympic Games in LA2028, i'd love my city to rally behind their Peachtree City Paralympian and push me to the top!

We've been working hard to keep this team since 2009. Baseball in Brazil is considered a strange sport full of confusing rules and long time limits. There's no professional play. The few existing baseball clubs are closely tied to the Japanese-Brazilian community, which tends to be closed and traditional, often creating obstacles to the game’s accessibility.
To start a baseball team in Brazil is no easy task. Equipment is very expensive as they are not sold in the country. To buy a simple 100 bucks glove, for example, it costs 800 bucks in our currency, considering shipping and taxes. There are only two baseball fields in our city and do not have lights, limiting opportunities for games and practice.
There are few baseball tournaments in Brazil. The only tournament for our level takes place 500km (315 miles) from our city, is only two-days long and costs $2000 USD.
This year, we were permitted to play in the city’s tournament against Japanese-Brazilian teams. However, this tournament costs $1.000 USD, and the games will occur in 7 weekends. Our team is limited in resources as our players come from different backgrounds such as students and people beginning their careers.
So we are asking for your help to raise money to pay for league fees, umpires and equipment. Any amount is helpful. We commit to share our receipts and list our expenditures. This financial help will give our team a chance to take the sport forward.
We are asking a bit more than USD 1.000 due to the website fees.

Text in Portuguese:
Embora o beisebol seja de origem norte-americana, no Brasil, por muitos anos, este esporte foi praticado e incentivado pela colônia japonesa. Ainda assim, a divulgação do beisebol no Brasil é muito pequena, consequentemente, um esporte pouco praticado. Uma das maiores dificuldades encontradas pelos amantes do beisebol é a aquisição dos equipamentos. Para comprá-los, precisamos pedir a amigos e parentes, que viajam para exterior, trazer os equipamentos.
O Lapwings Baseball Curitiba é um time brasileiro Amador de Beisebol, cujo início se deu por conta de um grupo de amigos que apreciava o esporte, logo resolveram se reunir e ao longo de desafios e dificuldades criaram o time. Por não possuirmos no país nenhum time profissional podemos nos considerar os amadores dos times amadores. A equipe conta, atualmente, com a supervisão de um ex-jogador profissional e técnico cubano, o José Santamaria, que veio ao Brasil para treinar as categorias de base da seleção Brasileira de Beisebol e ficou treinando times locais.
Um dos desafios que enfrentamos é o local para realizar os treinos. Em Curitiba há apenas dois campos públicos de beisebol. Esses campos têm que ser divido entre os clubes de beisebol curitibanos. Entretanto, esses times treinam diferentes categorias (pré-júnior, júnior, adultos, etc). Esses campos não possuem iluminação adequada para treinos/jogos noturnos. Como os integrantes do Lapwings trabalham e/ou estudam durante a semana, disponibilizamos somente os finais de semana para treinar, se estamos utilizando o campo e não há nenhum outro disponível temos que liberá-los pois os times locais têm prioridade sobre os campos.
No decorrer do ano, participamos apenas de um grande torneio, o Torneio Nacional de Beisebol que ocorre na cidade de Ibiúna, interior do estado de São Paulo. Este torneio apresenta um custo aproximado de USD 2.000 (BRL 8.000), infelizmente, nem todos os 14 atletas ativos do time podem custear a viagem. No entanto, fazemos grandes esforços para levar a equipe toda para o campeonato.
Não há muitos torneios amadores de beisebol no Brasil, quanto tem o nível técnico é alto a times iniciantes como o nosso não são nem convidados ou não conseguem ir devido a distância e ao custo. Com isso tentamos ao máximo jogar, nem que seja com adolescentes dos times locais.
O time tem um caixa apertado, no torneio nacional de beisebol gastamos no total USD 2.000 (BRL 8.000) em uniformes, inscrições, viagem, alimentação e material. Nós não conseguimos bancar dois torneios de valores elevados durante o ano, BRL 8.000 (Torneio Nacional) + BRL4.000 (Liga Curitibana de Beisebol 2016, que queremos participar). Nossos jogadores são estudantes de ensino médio, universitários, pessoas em busca de recolocação profissional e apenas alguns trabalham, das mais diversas classes sociais. Infelizmente aqueles que trabalham não conseguem bancar os custos dos torneios e materiais para todos do time, e para encontrar um patrocinador no meio de uma crise econômica no Brasil já é difícil, imagine agora para um esporte não conhecido no Brasil.
Nós vamos competir na Liga Curitibana de Beisebol em 2016, porém o custo será um desafio. Por isso precisamos arrecadar a quantia de USD 1.000 (BRL 4.000), para pagar o torneio, árbitros, alimentação e outras despesas. Pedimos a sua ajuda para nossa participação no torneio, qualquer valor doado já nos ajuda. Nós nos comprometemos a divulgar recibos de despesas, e outros gastos. Essa ajuda financeira dará ao time a oportunidade de dar um passo à frente no esporte.

Always encouraged to be active and to try new sports by my family in my hometown of Alliston, ON, I began rowing with the Barrie Rowing Club in July of 2008.  This experience kick-started my rowing career as I made, first, the University of Ottawa novice rowing team, followed by the varsity team. The camaraderie with the athletic exertion cemented my passion for rowing and I was hooked, becoming not only athletic competitor, but also very involved within the organization.  My drive to continuously push my rowing skills past personal boundaries enabled me to develop quickly within the competitive Ottawa Rowing Club and University of Ottawa (uOttawa) programs.  
         In 2011, I began looking towards becoming part of the Under 23 National Team after helping the uOttawa rowing team win its highest ever standing and medal count at the Provincial and National Championships.  After winning the Under 23 Trials in 2012, I was invited into the National Team selection camp.  Unfortunately, I suffered a severe rib injury during selection and was unable to row for the remainder of the season.  Although I was upset to lose my eligibility for this team, I persevered and recovered with the same dream to represent Canada. This brings me to the present day. After finishing my chemistry degree in 2013, I have been competing in a variety of rowing regattas across Canada and the USA. Due to a complicated hand injury, I was, however, unable to compete in the 2014 spring selection for the Senior National Team, another setback. Needing stability in my daily training, I returned to my home club in Ottawa and received amazing encouragement and support. Luck was in my favour, as I have been selected as a member of the 2014 World University Rowing Canadian Team.   
 As I make my first step onto the world stage in Gravelines, France this September, I know that I have done everything possible to compete at my best.  This is an opportunity that I cannot pass up, although it is an expensive, fully self-funded event.  My fundraising challenge will cover flights, transportation, accommodation, regatta fees, boat rental and some food. As a recent graduate and full time athlete, support of any kind goes a long way in helping me reach my dream.  Your support will make a difference to my success and together we can win for Canada.  I want to thank all my family, friends, teammates, coaches and beyond for their continued belief in me; I would not be here without all of you! Rowing is my lifestyle. Your contributions will make an impact and I hope to pass this on in years to come.  Please share my story and together we will row to the podium!   THANK YOU!

We created this campaign because amateur Muay Thai is entirely self-funded. Not a huge deal when the fights are local, however when we travel internationally, in this case from Ottawa to Oklahoma, the expenses add up quickly.

I will be using the funds for:
We'll be using the funds to help with the cost of airline tickets and hotel. Since it's a tournament format, it's impossible for the promoter to cover travel expenses for all the athletes competing (approx 150-200) from Canada, USA, and Mexico. Thus 100% of the travel and accommodation expenses are the athlete's responsibility. Airfare total is 3600 (600/person (4 fighters + 2 coaches) and hotel is 400 for the weekend. We've already raised part of the funds thanks to The Elmdale Tavern and Oyster House, but need some help to achieve the rest of the goal!

We are the Ottawa Gee Gees Men’s Baseball Club, a group of university of Ottawa student athletes and have had passion for the sport of baseball since a young age.

Our dream is to contend for the National Championship. We are located in the National Capital, playing in the highest level of baseball. We would like to represent the University of Ottawa as well as the city of Ottawa in the top baseball program in Canada.    

Why We Are Running the Campaign

The reason we are running the campaign is to be able to sustainably play as a competitive club team. We currently have a very tight budget that requires each player to pay to play and represent their own school.

We need to over the cost of facility rental for all of our games and practices. There are also league fees we have to pay just to play in the league and we are desperately in need new equipment as our current equipment is out dated. We play out of the Northern Conference which means we have to travel to Montreal for weekend double heads and weeknight games. Additionally, every home game we host we have to pay for umpires. We have a website that there are fees for and also marketing fees. We hope to make the playoffs each year and the goal is to get to the National Championship. The team has been using the same uniforms for years and it’s time for a new looks. Everyone that is involved with the team has a strong passion for the game of baseball and love the sport, and your support means the world to us.

My late tennis coach, Bill Van Lieshout, passed away on June 16th, 2011 of pancreatic cancer. Bill was a Physical Education Teacher at Merrill Middle School in Oshkosh, Wisconsin for 30 years, and the Boys and Girls Tennis Coach at Oshkosh North High school for 27 years. Tennis was a large part of Bill's life, both personally and professionally. Bill met his wife Sandy, while teaching at the Bachman-Laing tennis camp at Lawrence University in Appleton, and founded the Oshkosh Tennis Association Program at Oshkosh North High School. In the 1990's, Bill built a summer program that more than doubled the amount of youngsters receiving tennis instruction on public courts in Oshkosh.  
In the early 2000s, demographic and economic changes threatened the future of tennis at Oshkosh North, and the courts needed repair.  When most other guys would have been looking for a way out, Bill began to work for funding to not only renovate but expand the crumbling six court complex.  His years of work culminated in a brand-new eight court facility at Oshkosh North.  
Since his passing, the Bill Van Lieshout Tennis Classic has been created in an attempt to keep his dream alive. The tennis tournament, housed at the Oshkosh North High School courts, raises money to do just that.
By donating to the BVLTC program, you will support the Oshkosh North tennis teams and help to resurface the high school courts when needed (usually done every 4-8 years, costing upwards of $20,000). Money will also be used to purchase team uniforms and improve team play. Any donation will help!
Help to keep my late coach's dream alive!
Thank you everyone!

Why I am doing this campaign: I am raising funds to be able to offset cost of my spring hockey season. I’ve participated in the following competitions this year. These are:
Montreal Meltdown, Montreal QC, 24-26 May 2019
Future Stars Cup, Halifax NS, 17-19 May 2019
East Coast Ice Battle, Moncton NB, 3-5 May 2019
Oyster Cup, PEI, 19-21 Apr 2019
I wanted to find a way to contribute to all the support my family has
given me over the last couple of years and with this awesome spring season. My team and I, 2008 NB ICE finished in 2nd place at our last tournament vs a strong NS Stars team. We keep getting better with every game and determined to win our division at our final tournament the Montreal Meltdown! My spring season record is 7w-2L-0T with 1 shutout and 3 Player of the Game awards, and looking to improve it every game moving forward. I am very excited for this trip to Montreal and very nervous, I have an evaluator coming to watch me play and hope I perform well. I am still passionate about goaltending and, ESPECIALLY, more determined than ever to win! For me, this is more than a simple dream but a real project I am working hard on daily.
My strength? Without any doubt my determination and optimism.
Every dollar would be well appreciated! Thanks for encouraging me ! :)

My name is James Moler and I am from Orlando, FL, USA. I am truly passionate about fighting in the Armored Combat League, which I exercise as often as I can. My goal is to become one of the best athletes in my sport, and I need your help to turn the impossible into a reality.
To excel, I need to be constantly push my limits. I am ready to work hard, but at the same time, I know that the road to success will be costly. By supporting me today, you are investing into something bigger than just a fundraiser. You're changing my life!!
I just recently joined the Armored Combat League, which I am now a member of the newly formed team, the Orlando Black Knights, and I am trying to raise money to compete in the sport. The armor is not cheap, and it's hard to save with a family of four kids. I currently have the helm, legs, and shins ordered since joining in June, and the ""soft kit"" required for training. Unfortunately, I need at least $2800 to get the rest of the gear required to compete. Currently I have about $220 saved, and I have already purchased an AX & Buckler Shield used for combat. I started this page in hopes that others might be sympathetic or willing to donate towards my goals. The items still needed are the body, shoulders, arms, gorget, sabatons, gauntlets, and gambeson.

I’m Yannick, a bareback rider, giving it my all on every horse I get. Injuries come with this sport, but a cowboy knows how to cowboy up (suck it up) and ride some more. My teammate Alain, a saddle bronc rider, has done just that. Overcoming illness and injury, Alain is looking forward to the new rodeo season. To perfect our skills, we are heading West to train with some of Canada’s top cowboys.
Notre rêve est de faire la montée de chevaux sauvages partout au pays. Je m'appelle Yannick et je suis un cowboy qui monte sans selle (bareback). Je donne ma meilleure performance sur toutes mes montures en but d’améliorer ma technique. Malgré ses blessures, un cowboy se relève à chaque fois qu’il tombe. Mon coéquipier Alain, un cowboy qui monte avec selle, a surmonté des défis de santé et de blessures pour faire ce qu'il aime le plus. Cette année, nous retournons dans l'Ouest Canadien pour se faire instruire par quelques-uns des meilleurs cowboys au Canada.

Here’s a short video from last year of Alain and Jack, the school organizer, talking about the Millarville Rodeo School. Voici une vidéo d’Alain et de l'organisateur Jack qui présente l’école de Rodeo à Millarville.

 
Like most sports, bronc riding incurs many expenses. We will be using these funds for our training at the Millarville Rodeo School in Alberta. Also, we will be able to replace some worn out equipment and cover other expenses such as entry fees.
Les fonds amassés seront utilisés pour perfectionner notre monte des chevaux sauvages à Millarville, en Alberta. De plus, cet argent nous permettra de remplacer l’équipement désuet ainsi que des frais de participation aux rodéos locaux.

The Ralston Regals are a semi-professional box lacrosse team competing in the Interstate Box Lacrosse Association, also known as the IBLA. Check out their website at www.iblalacrosse.com/ to see what the league is all about!

We are a self-funded organization that takes great pride in bringing high quality lacrosse to the city of Omaha and the state of Nebraska. We want to continue for years to come! In 2019, we won the RBLL-Nebraska region of the IBLA, sending us to the national tournament, where we competed with some of the best players in the nation and placed 9th. Our hope is to raise enough money to continue using facilities for practice and games, obtain new uniforms for the team for our away games, and of course, to grow the game nationally. 

We are so excited to take the field this season and cannot express our appreciation enough for everyone who chooses to support us. We all truly love the game of lacrosse and we couldn't do any of this without your support. Thank you!

Everyone knows that competitive cheerleading can be expensive, and for athletes that are low to middle income, this door can be closed due to financial burden upon their families. 

I started out coaching for Upward Cheer at a local church in my hometown.  After that, I went to the USASF Midwest Regional Meeting in Chicago, IL in 2014.  I was originally going to open a dance studio, but after learning that most combine the two together, I wanted to gain more knowledge and experience.  After I returned, I found out that I wouldn't be able to return back to college in order to finish what I started.  I applied for a job as a junior high cheer advisor, and built the cheer program from the ground up over the span of 2 years.  After a series of unfortunate events, I was forced to leave the cheer advisor position there.  The students though, from a poverty area, inspired me to start a program that would benefit athletes.  When I came back to my region from a failed relocation, I started to work towards this program.

After 2 years, part of the program is starting up at the recreation center of which I work at as a gymnastics, tumbling, and cheer coach.  The reason that I am doing this is for one simple reason: have an affordable cheer program in the region for low to middle income families, for athletes to be able to have not only the opportunity to learn life lessons, but to also be able to compete and have opportunities they otherwise wouldn't have. 

I am raising money to be able to get the program started, which includes not only the business end (business license, money for training, going to conferences for networking, etc), but also for uniforms, t-shirts, marketing, and mats to name a few. ",11.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,0.0,15.0

And now, I finally have the opportunity to take that passion to the professional level.
After my performance at the Formula Renault Eurocup this year, invitations to compete professionally have been pouring in from Europe to Russia, to Malaysia and China - these are the kinds of opportunities I have been training for since I was just a kid.
But as you can imagine, now is a difficult time to dream.
Our country is facing severe economic challenges, and athletes can no longer rely on the government for support.
The needy, the unemployed, and those who are most economically vulnerable, must come first during this difficult time in our history.
So instead of turning to the government, I am turning to my community.
Help me to race this year in the FIA Formula 3 Asian Championship and put Cyprus on the map in the exciting world of Formula racing.
The  FIA Formula 3 Asian Championship has launched the careers of many professional drivers, and is a key stepping stone to Formula 1.
I am confident that this series is the best platform for transforming my dream into a reality. After competing two years in Formula 4 and one year in Formula Renault Eurocup,my results were very encouraging.
Representing Cyprus at the Formula Series  will also strengthen economic ties between our countries, and provide well-needed exposure for the island Cyprus.
And of course, I will not stop there.
My ultimate goal is to make it to Formula 1, and when I do, the opportunities for Cyprus will be unlimited.
But I can only get there with the support of my community.
My funding target is €50000 .
This amount will cover:
All the damages of the car for 2019
The cost of the car and mechanics for each race
The cost of the engineering team that will support me at each race
If I do not reach this target unfortuantely I will miss out on the most crucial next step of my racing career, and a huge opportunity for Cyprus will be lost.
So please, donate any amount you can. Every contribution, no matter how small or large, takes us that much closer to success.

Our season has come to an end after a tough loss to the San Diego Old Aztecs.  However the campaign will now run in order to help kit up the team for next season.  Please continue to spread the word so your Oceanside Chiefs can be properly fitted for next season!  And we look forward to a great Seven’s season starting in 2 weeks!!!!!!!


The Oceanside Chiefs are on the hunt for a second National Championship as one of the youngest rugby clubs in Southern California.  Since 2012, the Chiefs have dominated the competition,  even winning the Men’s Club Division III National Championship in their first year of existence!  Even in this relatively short time frame, the Chiefs have won multiple seven’s tournaments, conference and regional titles as well as numerous playoff berths.  We now need the community's help and invite you to join our organzation’s journey to the podium.  In order to do so, we need your donations to help us make it their.
The average cost of a season for a rugby team is approximately $6,000-$9,000, and that does not include the costs of playoffs with additional travel expenses. The club is entirely self-sustaining on the shoulders of their athletes who pay annual team dues to fund our sport.  We are one of the few teams without any sponsors to help allievate the out of pocket costs each athlete sacrifices.
Unlike the many clubs in the San Diego Area, we have not existed for 40+ years, we do not have large community of former players/boosters for support, we do not have corporate sponsors for financial backing, we continue to use the same jersey’s we started with (no matter how torn they are), we do not possess a home stadium, we do not have a practice field with lights, and we have no trainers/first responders to patch us up on the field.  We are a barebones organization because Rugby is our passion, and as long as we have grass under our feet, we WILL compete.
By contributing, you are supporting The Oceanside Chiefs as an organization and its athletes. You are also becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, that is helping local athletes reach their dreams and achieve athletic excellence. Being a part of The Oceanside Chiefs is a big step forward in an athlete's development, and we pride ourselves in being one of the top teams in the San Diego area.
We are asking for your support and to help spread the word! Your contributions go straight to the club to help pay for traveling expenses as we anticipate play in Fort Worth, Texas for the Western Regional Championships (May 19-20) as well as the grand finale in Glendale, Colorado for the Men’s Division II National Title.  Any funds not used will go directly to acquiring new uniforms the team desperately needs.   Please team up with us!",9.0,2.0,5.0,20.0,2.0,23.0

A small but highly motivated team of American football needs your help. This is a team from a small city in Russia, which really wants to play American football, which, unfortunately, is not very popular in Russia. The team was founded on April 12, 2015 by the efforts of caring citizens. Hall rental, purchase of sports equipment, everything happens at the expense of the team, there are no sponsors and support from the administration. The shape of the guys almost fell into disrepair. The team actively attracts citizens, tries to talk about this sport, holds promotions in shopping centers to attract sponsors, but so far unsuccessfully. Periodically, in order to save money for hall rent, the team trains in the winter on the street. Do you know what the Russian winter is? It's snowing, minus 15 outside. But even such difficulties and inconveniences did not break the players.The guys need this money to update the form, protection and sports equipment.
Donations will be used to purchase sports equipment and prepare for the summer season of 2019.


   Let's give people the opportunity to develop this wonderful sport and achieve more than 1 victory per season.

At this season I was 5th at the European Championship in Plovdiv, Bulgaria and 5th on World Championship in Račice, Czech . I competed in KL2 200m discipline.

Last season I made improvement of 2,8 seconds which is very huge for short distance races like 200 meters. I want to continue training and becoming better and better but now I am in hard situation . I finished my high school and this year I will go on college and will live completely alone. At the February of 2018 I will get my first sport schoolarship from state of Serbia .
If you help me to focus only on the studying and training I think I can make great results in the next season and maybe take a medal on European or World Championship. I will need some money to the February to live healthy life . So please help me in making my dreams come true.

It’s often assumed that the road to competition at that level involves a great deal of experience, the most expensive kit and regular and formal coaching but Nicole and Danny’s route to the GB team has been very different.  
At 17, Danny has only just reached the age at which individuals are allowed to compete at Olympic Distance Triathlon and this was only his second event of this type, competing for his place on the age-group podium against much older and more experienced athletes. Danny is studying for his A -levels at the Isaac Newton School in Norwich and managing his academic work with his training has meant that he has not been able to follow a fixed regime.
Nicole, 21, has faced a challenge also in balancing her University studies with training for the event. Having completed the Kalmar Ironman in Sweden last year, her training and race performances consistently place her highly in her age group.
They both fund their exploits with part-time jobs as Lifeguards and though this pays for entry to local events and some of the training kit, it definitely doesn’t stretch to funding the aerodynamic time-trial specific bikes of his fellow competitors. Danny successfully competes on a bike made from spare parts for his birthday!
Nicole and Danny are looking to raise enough money to represent their country in September with the help of your support. In the run-up to the event, they will be blogging about the life of an age-group triathlete and their training and discussing his ambitions to take their performances to the next level in triathlon. Check out their website for more information: beckfamiyracing.wix.com/triathlon
Not only will age group competitors converge from around the World to take each other on but the professional athletes, including our own World and Olympic success stories, Alistair and Jonny Brownlee, will compete for a place at the 2016 Olympics. Below is a minimum breakdown of costs required to get each to follow them to Chicago; any more funding on top of this will go towards equipment and more kit to put your logo on:
Entry fee: £265
GB Tri-suit: £160 
Food & Accommodation x 5 nights = £1075
Local transport in Chicago: £20 
Flights: £800
Bike Box hire: £120
Airport transfers: £60
Total: £2,500 (Total for both: £5000)

After our numerous medals in Serbia and Balkan, we decided to continue professional development and to be a part of the biggest beach volley tournaments in the world.
We plan to participate in more than ten tournaments around the world in 2019, in order to increase our ranking on the world FIVB list. We would also compete on the Continental Cup, Beach Volley Marathon, BVA Zonal Event, National Championships and the Serbian Championship. One of our long-term goals is to qualify for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Our achievements in 2018:
The top rated beach volley team of the Serbian Championship
Vukasin Rajkovic – MVP of the Serbian Championship
In seven tournaments of the Serbian Championship, we won six medals - one gold, two silver and four bronze
Gold medal at the National Bosnian beach volley tournament in Modrič
Beach Volleyball Marathon in Bibione (Italy) - 9th place from 132 teams
Croatian Beach Volleyball Championship in Zagreb - 4th place
BVA Zonal Event in Bursa (Turkey) - 5th place
Our team was formed in June 2018 by Nenad Tatić, the Serbian beach volleyball selector. We also work with the fitness coach Miloš Nikolić, psychotherapist Tamara Dinić Mirković and PR and marketing manager Teodora Jovanović. Our journey of being beach volley players has taught us so much, such as our strengths and weaknesses. To become world-class athletes we had to push our limits and develop incredible self-discipline.
In order to achieve all the goals, we need funds to cover our expenses on tournaments - registration fee, road trip, accommodation and food. We estimated that this season will require a budget of around 7,000 euros to cover only the basic tournaments costs. This is why we need your support.

My name is Sam Edney and I’m from Northland, New Zealand. Earlier this year my lifelong dream of being able to ride in the Mongol Derby came true. The Mongol Derby is the toughest horse race in the world, a 1000km endurance ride across the wild Mongolian steppe.
My passion is working with horses, I ride and handle racehorses full time and hope to train them one day. I see the derby as an opportunity to not only push my personal limits, but also to learn hands on from some of the best traditional horse people in history. What better way to do that than by riding a bunch of half wild Mongolian horses across the country? 
Obviously this race is no easy feat to make happen, and I’ll need to raise money for the entry fee with includes use of up to 25 different horses, to ensure animal welfare over such a huge distance, as well as proper equipment and compensation for the Mongolian families that look after riders along the way. I also need to raise money for my travel and training costs to give myself the best chance during the race. The ride is done for charity, and I have chosen to raise money for Ocean Spirit, a charitable trust working towards a healthy ocean, and educating people all around the world on how to help. This is something I am extremely passionate about, and I would love to support them by raising money doing the race. 
Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story, and any help is hugely appreciated. Join me on my trip to Mongolia! ",10.0,0.0,3.0,16.0,0.0,9.0

Through this campaign We hope to raise enough funds to be able to train and compete at the level necessary to make it all possible.
A lot of people don't realize how expensive training and competing really is, and how little income is actually made. Over a season each athlete in this sport can spend up to $620 for training and competition, and only make $1500 in prize money for the championship spot. So as the math shows, each season as an athlete you dive deeper into a pool of debt. That being said, I've not done this sport for the money, but for the love.
With money raised through MAKEACHAMP, We will be able to train and compete free of the worry and stress that finances play.
As a goalie, physical trainer and assistant coach, living and training is really hard. Attending training camps is needed as often as possible to maximize all of the other staff members and I.  We are also responsible for travel and accommodation, competition entry fees, facility fees and equipment, amongst other things. Your contributions will allow for the season to be possible.
We have been on the edge of success for the past years, and this is finally our year to break through. Support for our campaign is exactly what we need to make our goals a reality. Drive has never been an issue for us, financial backing has always been the ball and chain in our career holding us back. We have trained so hard to give up and we will not give up without a fight!

Since the age of 10, my dream has been to become one of the world's greatest tennis players. Inspired by players such as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and of course Lleyton Hewitt, I have been more passionate and a harder worker than any of my competitors.
From the ages of 10 to 18, I worked extremely hard with the vision that one day professional tennis would be my career. Training with local coaches and my father enabled me to continually improve my game, and I was on the road to becoming a professional.
 
After playing a handful of professional tournaments last year, I was able to attain an ATP ranking of 1927 in the world.  Whilst this is an achievement in itself, my ambitions are far greater.  In order to get to where I want, it's essential to travel the world playing tournaments on the pro tour. Unfortunately, Australia only hosts about 6 pro tournaments per year, which means that I must travel overseas to fulfil my mission.
 
I am now on the road to becoming a great professional tennis player, all I now need is some financial support.
Please click the following link to view a small clip of my running forehands - one of tennis' hardest shots:
https://youtu.be/w3kCVPkwkHk

How the Funds will be Used
The funds will be used to travel overseas playing professional tournaments.
 
Instead of just receiving donations, I would prefer to give back to those who have invested in me. Therefore, if you own a business and donate over a significant amount such as $2000, I will wear your business logo on all of my tournament attire for 3-12 months.  Keep in mind that I will be travelling overseas and this may be a good opportunity to expand your brand recognition, as well as providing me with the opportunity to fulfil my dream!
 
As Asia is obviously closer to Australia than Europe or the US, the more feasible option would be to play pro tournaments in Asia.  In particular, there are tournaments in Thailand, Australia and Malaysia in the upcoming months.
I anticipate that each overseas trip will cost on average $3000-$4000, hence, the target of $25,000 should fund 8 trips.

The target aims to fund 5 more trips similar to each of the above.

My Challenges
The main challenge for me is mainly financial, as I require the sufficient funds to travel and play overseas tournaments.
As someone who has faced many physical, emotional and spritual challenges in my 19 years, I like to view challenges as opportunities to learn and grow in stature.
    In this case, the two main challenges will involve continually improving my world ranking and remaining financially stable whilst travelling. 
Other challenges include:
- Preventing injuries
- Budgeting
- Maintaining positive personal branding
- Staying motivated, even during tough and dull times

Over the past two years I have been training hard towards becoming an Ironman age group world champion. To make this goal a reality I have competed in various events across New Zealand, developing the experience and skills to one day qualify for the Kona Ironman World Championships in Hawaii.
My latest triathlon was the 2021 Ironman NZ, raced in Taupo on the 27th of March.  I pushed hard during this event and achieved a 3rd place finish in my age group, which has subsequently qualified me to attend this year’s Kona in Hawaii, on the 9th of October 2021.

I’m excited that my hard work and training has now made my goal within reach, yet I’m uncertain how to make the trip to Hawaii a reality, given the financial commitment it places on my family.  Sadly we accept that the current international climate, created by Covid 19, will prevent my family from accompanying me to Hawaii, however I have their full support to find a pathway that allows me to attend.
This is why I’m reaching out for support to make this once in a lifetime opportunity come true.
The estimated costs are $16,000 NZD (refer breakdown below). This covers the entry fee, flights, accommodation, logistics and MIQ. The Covid environment has resulted in the higher than normal costs, however the entry qualification applies to the 2021 championship only.
I’m seeking support up to the value of $5,000, and would be extremely grateful for any financial contribution to assist me in the pursuit of mine.
Cost Breakdown:
• Entry fee; $1,860.05 NZD
• Flights; New Plymouth-Auckland-Kona return; $5,500.00 NZD
• Accommodation; 6 nights in Kona Hawaii @ $2,982.00 NZD
• Kona Logistics $600.00 NZD
• MIQ facility and expenses; 2 weeks @ $5,600 NZD",3.0,0.0,6.0,8.0,2.0,6.0

As in all sports, there are meets and nationals events and as in all things, it takes time and money. Our young Judo team has spirit, vitality, and the excitement to share what they have learned. They are the center of our world and we try to do everything we can to help them.
  I believe every child should have the opportunity to show their hard work, even if times are tough.

Hi, I’m Tanya Bottomley.  Im in my late 30’s and I have been running for over 10 years.  I first dreamed of running an ultra-marathon many years ago when I learnt of local running legend Lisa Tamati’s great achievements and thought I would like to achieve similar goals.
Fast-forward many, many years and I am now living my dream!
I have competed in a number of trail and road races from 5km to 161km and my latest 100 mile challenge really excites me.
I am an average woman.  I have a partner, day job, children, a house that is forever in a state of renovation and a mortgage.  I also have a huge drive and passion to see just how far and fast I can run, and I love to inspire people along the way.
I am a happy runner! I love my sport. It makes me so blissfully happy, even through the pain and struggle and that is portrayed in the way I run, happy and full of gratitude for what I am doing.
What:
Goal: To be the first woman to complete the This Southern Seasons Miler Challenge running four 100 mile races in a 12 month period.
The qualifying races are:
1.      The Old Forest Hanmer 100
2.      The Great Nasby Water Race
3.      Krayzie Kapers
4.      Northburn 100
Each race is 100 miles (that’s 161km) run non-stop until completion.  The 100 mile foot race is a battle of mind and body and requires a high level of fitness, huge mental strength and a good support crew.
Why:
The sport of ultra-running is still a relatively young sport and we are only just testing the bounds of what we are physically capable of. The challenge takes those bounds and pushes them a little further with a high volume race plan over a 12 month period.
This goal is particularly important to me as a woman, and it would be an honour to be the first woman to complete the challenge.  Trail running is a sport where women are coming into their own and proving to have great strength and endurance.
I want other woman to see me do this and see that anything is possible - you just have to chase your dreams and work for them!",4.0,2.0,5.0,11.0,1.0,5.0

About me:
My name is Stacey I am Officially Classified National Para Equestrian Dressage Rider, in few months time I will be International Classified with FEI so I can compete on the International stage representing my country with my new horse.
How did I became a Para Equestrian Rider?
Horse Racing was my life born into a racing family spent many years riding, driving caring for race horses. 
A few years ago while exercising a race horse that started bucking broncing , then stumbled got a fright, bolted,  I was dragged a few times around the track until they could stop and free me, terrified I layed there having trouble moving and breathing. 
Besides knee surgery I have patellofemoral disease of both knees, x4 spinal surgeries even tail bone has been removed.
The last two were very serious as I couldn't walk, spinal cord compression, after failed surgery my disc was useless surgeon said, squashed wasn't up to the job, leaking badly and pressing on nerves. 
Spinal fusion and disc removal (titanium cage rods screws in lower back) in Feb 2018 left me with right leg/foot permanent nerve damage.
My little girl has been my nurse just her and myself , best little helper everyday along with my father.

Olympic horses are born over there and the only way to achieve our goals of a medal is purchase one with the best breeding we can afford who will reach Grand Prix level.
2- Attend our first competion before end of the year.

My journey of being a Para rider has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally daily.

To become a world-class athlete you have to push your limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way onto a podium.
To be able to reach these goals this year I have to pay $30,000 this is purchasing a C grade horse from Europe which has passed vet check and        x-rays 100% including flights and quarantine.
This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my new horse (tax deductible)

Most horses are $40-75,000 by choosing a C Grade which is younger who ticks the boxes is a far better financial choice and cheaper than raising more money.
 By contributing you will help me reach my goals, take all the stress and worry away which has made me very sick recently and in turn my wee girl has been upset too.
You will also take part in our journey of becoming a gold medalist.
My campaign goals:
1- Purchase a new suitable tained Dressage Horse from Europe.
2- Attend our first competitons together locally then head around Australia, plan is qualify for UK Hartpury Dressage Festival and then Europeans where they have qualifers for Paralympic. But we are also happy to qualify in Australia so my supporters can come and watch.

I'm raising funds for:
A Para Rider requires suitable horse which needs to be purchased, these horses are exceptional Quality Warmbloods over 17hh Dressage trained , who have a fabulous temperament calm in all situations ,safe who look after their rider, under 8yrs with a walk, trot canter that really turns your eye, correct confirmation and no veterinary history.
Dressage horses are in Europe mainly The Netherlands and Germany.

Quality is very important, KWPN (Danish Royalty Horses) is an example of what we have selected to purchase, have found a perfect mount who now needs to be paid for then fly over.
A horse is the best form of medical, physical therapy each day helping my body recover, get fit and stronger. Push myself mentally and physically harder to achieve goals we have set.
Why I need your support:
Without your support in a financial compacity and sharing this page I am unable to achieve my goal of a beautiful horse to represent my country on a national and international level. Please help me achieve this. 
Without a horse, my life isn't complete anyone who loves and owns horses know, the feeling when loosing one, which I just have recently, she wasn't suitable so went back to her old owner as a broodmare. This has left a huge hole in my life, so stressed with trying to raise funds, making my health suffer.
Your help will make a huge impact on my life no stress, worry anymore, I can get on riding each day aiming for the next competition while receiving daily physical therapy rehabilitation riding and caring for my horse. Horses are my world ,my gorgeous pony loving daughter loves them just as much. I'm lost without that special horse to care for throughout the day 7 days a week ,365 days a year.

    Race for a Reason is a national event held on April 23rd across the country where countless organizations like us are running for a particular “reason”. Manzer Basketball Club was founded on the idea of giving every athlete an opportunity to chase their dreams. Our club was named after long time coach Dave Manzer who was a selfless man full of wisdom, knowledge, and care for both people and the game. Dave passed away in 2009, but his legacy will live on forever through our organization.

Started from Humble beginnings and victims of bullying themselves, the three owners - Alex, Glenn and Max, have donated their time and resources to help build this program out. While the gym is fully self-sustaining, the coaches do not collect a check or make money from their program. Their goal is to change lives not for profit!
Recently the Press Enterprise wrote an article about their passion to help kids.  You can read the article here : 
https://www.pe.com/2019/02/07/carl-love-bullied-as-kids-these-3-murrieta-martial-arts-teachers-are-h...
The Rise Academy goal for this 2019 is to provide 12 scholarships for kids who are being bullied, and cannot afford to get the help they need to stand up for themselves.  Rise will cover the cost of the training, but need your help. 
Through this campaign I hope to raise enough funds to be able to pay for the uniforms and equipment each child needs to train and feel part of the team. 

In addition, we need funds to buy a passenger van to be able to pick up the kids whose parents are working and cannot bring them into class. Kids should not miss out on the help they need because the parents are working to put food on the table. 

A lot of people don't realize how expensive learning self defense really is. At Rise, the owners, do not believe that cost should stop a child from being confident enough to go back to school and not worry about getting bullied, so they feel safe enough to really learn.
Please join the fight! With proper training and your support, their success in rebuilding the confidence and self esteem to feel safe again is ensured.

Girls join the team for a variety of reasons, not the least of which being school spirit, athletic challenges and an unshakeable bond with their team mates. 

Due to increasing budget cuts at the university, McGill had to remove cheerleading as a varsity sport in 2010. This means that our competitive club is 100% our financial responsibility: without fundraising, the McGill Cheerleading team simply would not exist. 

Every winter, our team competes in the University and Open National Cheerleading Championships in Brampton, Ontario. This means we need to raise $3000 for bus transport, team hotels and entrance fees to the competition.

The hard work that all clubs province wide have collectively put into growing the sport has been tremendous in the last 5 years and the Wanderers are looking to add to that collective in a serious way now and in the future years to come. 
MWRFC are going to be competing in the superleague for the 2016 season. Where we will face old friends like Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue RFC, The Montreal Irish RFC and Quebec City RFC. We hope to see as many old fans as new ones this summer to cheer on the boys in the black and blue at the Douglas pitch as it will surely be some exciting rugby to be seen.  
A Rugby club is a unique thing as it requires a tremendous amount of work, resources, people and late night conversations over some pints to make sure everything gets done properly and ultimately in the best interests for the club. If we reach our goal of raising $5,000 before the end of 2015 we will be in a net positive position of $3,000 going into 2016, which would be tremendous in kicking off the very exciting programs we have planned for 2016. Below is a quick list of what has already been piloted. 
1. New coaching staff led by Mr. Andy Richardson who's pedigree and coaching experience will give us the tools we need to stay in our position in the superleague in Quebec. 
2. Merged women's team with the Westmount Ravens lead by Mr. Kaneb Uphill. This is a big initiative that everyone is taking very seriously club side, as we are the only superleague team without a women's team! 
3. Launching of a downtown developmental program for junior rugby players that are playing at the high school level. 
Your contributions would go a long way in helping assure we get these initiatives the proper funding. Our long term vision for the club is to enrich the rugby community, develop young players and ultimately help them reach their rugby dreams! 
We want to talk to anyone who wants to reach out or get involved (there is enough work for everyone!, please don't hesitate to contact us. The whole club is working towards the future. 
Sincerely, 
Matt Barazin - MWRFC President

We are Belle&Rebel Freestyle, a professional skydiving team.
Our team founder and aerial performer, Karine Provost, is a former ballet dancer and experienced yoga instructor. However, at heart, she is a Sky Dancer. Her background in those disciplines reinforces her ability to perform her mid-air artistic routines and compete at the highest level within our undiscovered beloved sport.
What is Freestyle skydiving? It is a performance accomplished by the aerial artist, demonstrating multiple manoeuvres with fluidity, skill and elegance while being recorded by the team's cameraman. The recorded video of the artistic performance is then presented to the judges for scoring.
The days of just falling out of planes are over. Perfected free fall techniques allow us to move with ease and precision around each other.

The team's cameraman is Marc-Olivier Pinault, a professional aerial videographer, with more than 6000 skydives and many accomplishments under his belt such as skydiving world records and camera work for television shows and more.
We are extremely proud to be a competitive team with a fierce female athlete in a largely male dominated sport. We take pride in providing women in our sport opportunities to gather at events we host, made especially for them, which encourages them to be active in skydiving and competing in this amazing sport of ours. 
The team is now preparing for the 2016 World Parachuting Championships, in september, in Chicago.
We are competing against teams who receive support from their countries through funding and elaborate training programs. Our team is 100% self funded, as there is no budget in place to support skydiving athletes in Canada.
This is why we allow ourselves to approach the public and ask YOU to embark on our journey, support us, follow us and be part of the team as we prepare for what we consider to be, our very own olympics. 
Your support will help us recover part of the sizeable expenses we encountered during our training year, such as jump tickets, competition fees, travel fees, skydiving equipment, additional training at the indoor skydiving simulators, physical training expenses and services from nutrition professionals we have consulted. They can range upwards of 40 000$ per year.
We hope YOU will want to join the team.
Merci Beaucoup
Karine & Marc-Olivier

Our campaign objective is to assure we are sufficiently funded for the 2014-15 season, as well as to assure the program's viability for the future.  Our goal is to raise $10,000 through this campaign. 
 
The Carabins Alpine Ski Team is 95% self-funded. Financing for the program comes principally through student-athlete contributions, completed by corporate sponsorsorships as well as generous donors. This is why we need your support.We strive to achieve both academic as well as athletic excellence. Every donation is appreciated and important to us, your support is essential! 
Who we are
The men's and ladie's Carabins Ski Team from the Université de Montréal is a team whose mission is to drive towards athletic as well as academic excellence.  The demands of high-level ski racing has often resulted in atheltes having to put aside their education in order to suceed in their sport. Our program fully supports athletes in search of sporting excellence without having to compromise their academic or carreer aspirations.  The Carabins Alpine Ski Team is composed of high-level athletes selected year after year based upon their atheltic performance. The Team is composed of students who are enrolled at the UdeM, Polytechnique Montréal, HEC Montréal as well as a limited number of promising recruits from Montreal area CEGEPs . 
 
The Carabins Alpine Ski Team is also a large family whose members share common values and passions. No longer are athletes required to make a choice between their sport and their education - the Carabins provides an opportunity to excel in both categories. Our student athletes are enrolled full-time at university or college yet have proven they can continue to excel collectively and individually in ski racing.
Our achievements
2013-14 season: - Men's, Ladies' as well as Combined Team Champions on the RSEQ university circuit ;
- 9 podiums on the FIS Super-Série Sports Experts ski circuit ;  
33 total Championship Title Banners out of the available 45 such banners over the last 15 years - as well as 8 of the 9 last Ladies' Titles;3 Carabins Ski Team members represented Canada at the 2013 Universiades in Italy;Carabins Ski Team members have been retained for selection to represent Canada at the up-coming Universiades in Grenade in february 2015;Members of the Carabins Ski Team have also been selected to race on the NCAA ski circuit, the Canadian Alpine Ski Championships, as well as on the Nor-Am ski circuit;  Many Carabins Ski Team members have acceeded to the UdeM's sporting excellence academic honor roll.",10.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,28.0

There are exactly 8 months left before the end of the olympic qualification process and my goal is to end this period in the top 14 girls in the world in my weight class. My last results, proved to me that I do belong amongst the best in my category and made me believe my dream was even more achievable; I recently took a silver at the Panam Games, a gold in a World Cup in El Salvador and a bronze at the Panamericain championships. Realistically, I think that this goal is achievable, but I will need a lot of support.  I  will, of course be doing everything that I possibly can in order to reach this goal, but this dream is simply impossible without some support as I will need to compete in at least 10 more qualifying events before mid-may 2016. My next tournaments are 2 world cups; 1 in Australia and 1 in Mauritius. I am aiming  at taking 2 golds in these events, if I do, these results will bring me so much closer to the top girls in the world in the race for Olympic points. This year, I am more committed to accomplishing lifelong my dream and I can assure you will give my absolute best in training and in competition.

We, Ecaterina Guica and Stéfanie Tremblay, are two judo athletes aiming to represent Canada in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016. As the second and last year of qualification is underway, it is critical for us to take part in several international events in order to qualify and those tournaments are at our own expenses. We are looking for assistance in financing the upcoming months of competitions. Are you interested in helping?
In order to hope achieve a spot in the Top 14 girls in the World ranking of our division, and thus qualify to the Games, we need the funds to afford competing in at least 10 tournaments until May 2016. Most of the tournaments that give Olympic points take place in Europe, Asia, South America and even Oceania. We are both in good position (top 30) so we know our goal is realistic, but without financial support, it will be impossible.
We are hoping to engage 20 people or groups of people (i.e. from a business or company) to donate $100/month to each of us for 10 months in order to fund our competitions until Rio.
20 to RIO partners can keep track of our activities andprogress towards Rio 2016 on our athlete's Facebook pages. We will give each contributor a signed poster thanking you for the support. Several other promotional activities can be organized as well.
Help us realize our dream and inspire others. We often visit schools, participate in various youth activities and host clinics to encourage young people to stay physically active and “dream big”.",,,,,,

Here is what some of the players are saying as to why we created this campaign:
Adriana: To Help us strive towards our goal of becoming a dominate team in the league.
Camille: It takes a team to make the dream work.
Vittoria: Allowing us to show that coming together is beginning. Staying together is progress. Working together is success.
Ashique: It allows us to reach our goal financially and make it an option for other Dawson teams to participate.
I will be using the funds for:
It is not easy for us to achieve our goals with the current funding so we created this campaign to help us pay for yearly tournaments, equipment, gear, transportation and accommodations. Not only are we a dedicated team with ambitious goals but we play our hearts out day in and day out. Our passion is not just winning but also standing up for what we believe in and with the right team anything can be overcome. We've shown this in the past and we will continue to show it. We want to also set up a ""Breast Cancer Game"" to where one of our coach's niece will talk about dealing with cancer at age 28. We'll also bring together people for a ""Vitiligo Game"" where a Former player speaks about living with Vitiligo.
Your contribution means:
Your support will help our athletes concentrate on their education and training. With the funds we will be a productive team on the court and in the class rooms.

Our Division II Women's Basketball program has maintained a high percentage of graduating athletes who went on to achieve success at the University level.

Wise & Other Wise
This is the story about four people
Named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody.
There was an important job to be done and
Everybody was sure that Somebody would do it.
Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it.
Somebody got angry about that, because it was
Everybody's job. Everybody thought that Anybody
Could do it, but Nobody realized that Everybody
Would do it. It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody
When Nobody did what Anybody could have done!!!!

The power of teamwork is undeniably the most important key in any successful program. Everybody, Somebody, Anybody & Nobody = Teamwork

On behalf of the coaching staff and athletes we would like to thank Dawson College, our Families, Friends and Fans for their continued support.

Participation au Tour de l’Abitibi.  Nous sommes une équipe cycliste sur route de niveau Junior (U-19) et le but de cette levée de fond est de nous permettre de participer au Tour de l’Abitibi qui se déroulera du 19 au 24 juillet 2016 dans la région de Rouyn-Noranda, Québec.  
Le Tour de l’Abitibi est une course internationale à étapes qui accueillera cette année jusqu’à 180 coureurs pour une semaine de compétition intense. Cette épreuve figure au calendrier de la Coupe des nations Junior UCI (Union cycliste internationale) qui compte au total 7 épreuves. C’est la seule manche à être présentée en dehors de l’Europe, ce qui fait du Tour de l’Abitibi l’évènement cycliste junior le plus reconnu et convoité en Amérique du Nord.
C’est un occasion unique de se mesurer aux meilleurs coureurs junior du pays mais aussi des États-Unis, et de plusieurs pays d’Europe et d’ailleurs.
Nous avons la chance de compter sur l’expérience d’un des entraîneurs les plus chevronnés du cyclisme amateur québécois, Yannick Bédard, qui a dirigé de nombreuses formations au plus haut niveau de sport, y compris des sélections nationales, au Tour de l’Abitibi.
Notre objectif : tenir notre rang et rivaliser avec les meilleures équipes régionales qui participeront à cette épreuve.
Les fonds seront utilisés pour :
Une équipe se compose de 6 coureurs, un entraîneur, un mécanicien/chauffeur et un soigneur/massothérapeute.
Les frais d’inscription, d’hébergement et de subsistances qui doivent être versés aux organisateurs sont de $5,000. Les salaires supplémentaire ainsi que les frais de voyagement s’élèvent à $3,000 pour un grand total de $8,000.
Le budget de notre équipe ne nous permet pas de participer à cette course prestigieuse qui constitue l’épreuve de référence pour tout cycliste amateur des rangs espoirs. Nous avons donc besoin de votre appui.
Votre contribution représente :
Chaque dollar amassé servira uniquement à financer notre participation au Tour de l’Abitibi. Vous nous permettrez de vivre une expérience sportive et humaine unique dont nous conserverons le souvenir toute notre vie. Peu importe l’adversité ou les difficultés, nous nous engageons à concourir avec fierté et ténacité afin de vous témoigner notre reconnaissance.
Merci beaucoup, le VCM-Cycle ABC

Our athtletic goal is:
We are a junior cycling team (U-19) and the purpose of this fundraiser is to allow us to enter the Tour de L’Abitibi which takes place from July 19 to 24, 2015, in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec.
The Tour is an international stage race, spreading over seven days and which will host some 180 racers. This event is the most prestigious and coveted race in North America and forms part of  the UCI Juniors Nation’s Cup. This is a unique occasion for us to compete against the best junior racers in the country, as well as from the USA, Europe and beyond.
We are coached by Yannick Bédard, an experienced directeur sportif who has led several teams at the highest level, including national teams at the Tour de l’Abitibi.
Our goal:  to hold our ground and compete head-to-head with the best regional teams entered in the race.
We will be using the funds for :
We need your support to allow us to measure ourselves against the very best.
A team consists of 6 racers, a coach, a mechanic/driver and a soigneur.
The registration fees (including full board) amount to $5,000.  Additional salaries and travel costs amount to $3,000 for a total of $8,000.
Your contribution means :
Each dollar that you will donate will be used to finance our participation at the Tour.  Your generosity will allow us to live a sportive and human experience that is unique and that we will mark us for the rest of our lives.  No matter how hard it is or the bad luck, we promise to keep fighting with pride and determination in order to show you our gratitude.
With all our thanks!

We started our Montreal Wolfpack Elite Summer program in 2013 with a strong group of players, but a lack of funding stopped us from showing our talents throughout North America. It is my goal to reach out and showcase our teenagers' talent to North America and give these kids an experience they truly deserve.

Last year we had hoped to go to 5 tournaments in the United States but were unable to go to them due to a lack of finances. This year my goal is to give these teenagers the best summer possible after a positive yet incomplete first experience. I feel responsible for not giving them everything they deserved after working extremely hard through and through adversity last summer. I fear letting them down again will turn them away from basketball, the sport that we love, that our coaching staff grew up with. It was basketball that kept us together and out of trouble. I want to be able to share my experiences with them as well.

As a program, our goal, year after year, is to expose our teenagers to North American competition and create a experience where at the end, the coaches and players can call each other family. I've been coaching for 5 years now, and I've not experienced a more outstanding feeling than feeling like a family and being able to rely on each other and trust that your teammates will have your back.

Contributing to our program will allow our athletes, ages 15 and 16, to experience a summer of basketball and training where they will grow individually as players but also learn how to interact and communicate as a one. We don't only teach basketball with these teens, we look to help them as men too.  Last year we only went to 2 tournaments in the United States but were able to take one of those two championships nonetheless. 

Our goal is to raise 5000$. We will be using it to register for tournaments, rent hotel rooms, cars and pay for gas. We are lucky enough to have the YM-YWHA Community Center providing us with excellent facilities, we thank them very much.

If you want to help, but are unable to contribute you can still help out in a huge way. Get the word out, share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Anything is helpful. 

We have a YM-YWHA Wolves Basektball facebook group that you can visit as well.

The McGill Alpine Ski Team is made up of student athletes who remain serious about their education while interested in continuing to pursue competitive ski racing at a high level.

We will continue to compete against teams from Université de Montréal, Université de Laval and Concordia at all of our races, with certain F.I.S races drawing in teams from American schools such as Harvard, Dartmouth University, Middlebury College, University of New Hampshire and more.

We are creating this campaign to reach out for support as we take on this new challenge. The circuit is becoming more competitive each season, and our competition this year will include a handful of former Canadian National Ski Team athletes. Last season, our women's team placed second, missing out on the gold by only a few points in the standings.

Ringuette Quebec will contribute $2500 towards the airfare, but the rest of the funding must be raised by the team.
We are a group of athletes who are extremely passionate about our sport (even our friends do not understand our commitment to this fantastic team game that is often called the fastest sport on ice) and have dreamed all year about achieving the opportunity to go to the National Tournament to represent Quebec. We have worked extremely hard this year as a team, by practicing 1-2 times per week, training once per week as a team, and competing 1-2 times per weekend. This schedule was all done in addition to full time studies for all of the team members.
The funds raised in this campaign will help us immensely to achieve our goal of going to the 2015 Canadian Ringette Championships, in order to compete with the best teams in Canada. This type of competition helps us to become better athletes, and for several of our team members this will be their last opportunity to compete at this level for Lac St. Louis, after spending their entire youth (since age 5) playing for this region.

We have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! Two time bronze medalists, we are determined this year and we have what it takes to bring home the gold. Help us reach our goal!
The average cost of a season per athlete is approximately $200. This covers most of the costs for the season in terms of equipment (except shoes), transportation for away games and gym use. Our goal as coaches is to provide our athletes with the means to keep in good academic standing while maintaining optimum level of play throughout the season. By that we mean obtaining tutors and mentors and helping to cover the cost for those athletes who are in difficulty.
By contributing, you are supporting Dawson Blues and its athletes. You are also becoming part of something extraordinary that is helping young athletes reach their life goals both in academics and in sport. Being a part of the Dawson Blues is a big step forward in an athlete's development, and we believe we can take them to the next level.
We are asking for your support and to help spread the word! Please team up with us!",0.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,0.0,11.0

We are the Dawson College Blue Men Rugby Team, we play at the collegiate level in Montreal and its Regions. We have participated in the provincial final every year for the past 8 years, we have won the title once. Our college is based in downtown Montreal and is predominately English speaking which makes for a strong turnout of young Rugby players from all over the city.
Our long term goals are to be the premier Rugby developmental program in Montreal so that we can recruit the top talent and bolster the Rugby community all over the city.
Campaign goals:
We're running this campaign in order to increase funding available to the team.
This is very important as we are normally restricted in access to funding from the academic system. With young enthusiastic coaches, a strong showing of athletes year over year all we are missing is a strong financial backing.
to name a few of the events we indeed to participate in: Multiple friendly games around USA North East, 7's Tournament in NYC.
We currently practice 3 times a week with a game on the weekend. The athletes, coaching staff and athletic therapists involved with this team take it very seriously, please see our pictures and videos to see just how hard were training day in and day out!
We indeed to use the funds to immediately create a teamsnap account so that we can be better organized with all members of the organization. Afterwards we will be purchasing balls, tackling bags, field rentals (indoor), out of province games (transportation, accommodations, etc).
We will document all funds and respective expenditures in order to create a transparent and trustworthy community. Any and all funds that are not spent will roll over into the next season.
The contributions to this team will go a long way. Like I said before one of the only restrictions we have is financing in order to participate and train to our maximum. On week 1 of tryouts we had over 30 young men ages 16-20 show up to make the team, if you know Rugby, you know that is unprecedented, help us retain these youngsters, sharpen their rugby skills which in turn will teach them life skills that will serve them for the rest of their lives as they become men.

André Laurendeau and MAKEACHAMP are partnering for the first time to enable crowdfunding for college sports, with 11 teams spanning from hockey to golf setting out to raise an ambitious $50,000.

The women's hockey team campaign has already raised more than 30% of its fundraising goal. You can follow the success of the other campaigns with the slider above.

“Athletes used to sell chocolate door-to-door to finance their sports ambitions. That’s a thing of the past now. The MAKEACHAMP platform makes it possible for athletes to raise necessary funds.” said David Barkay, president and CEO of MAKEACHAMP.  Competing athletes that become champions promote health and wellness benefits for themselves and those that they inspire, building a strong sense of community success. Yet the vast majority of them struggle for the funding they need to compete nationally and internationally, including equipment, travel and training costs.

Friends, family, organisations and the overall André Larendeau community can support their athletes’ drive to become champions and follow their journey to athletic achievement via ongoing updates during, after and in between funding campaigns. With the power of social media, the engagement of press, and the athlete’s own commitment to their campaign, every competitive athlete now have the tools to successfully overcome financial barriers.",7.0,0.0,1.0,11.0,1.0,6.0

We understand that consistent hard work is what will help us accomplish our goals on and off the court. Today, I am reaching out to you, so that as a team we can relieve the stress of some of the financial aspects in being student athlete.
As you are well aware, playing basketball is a passion to me, to play basketball we have to Pass our classes, practice 3-4 times per week as well as make some of us work part time jobs. On top of that we do fundraising to help pay for extra tournaments, buses, hotels, track suits and more. It would be a great honor, if you could be so generous to donate anything to our team! Every dollar helps and is very much appreciated!
Thank you so much for the time and consideration!
A message from the coaches!
Our goal as a Staff has always been to coach our players to compete at the highest level. Not only the highest level in basketball but also in life. Our goal is to raise better men so that they can be the leaders in the future. Throughout the year, we do a number of exercises with them so that they can learn to communicate clearly, be leaders as well bond as teammates and consider themselves to be family by the end of the year!
Obviously this is a challenge since all the players have different backgrounds, from age, religion and beliefs; however when they are all put on a common course the bond happens quicker.
A lot of people don't realize how expensive training and competing really is, and how little income is actually made. Over a season an athlete pays 500$ to register on our team. On top of that most of them have jobs, and do volunteer work with our team, as well as study for their classes which they must pass or they are not eligible to play.
These young men are hard workers, determined and have dreams and goals that they are focused on achieving.
With money raised through MAKEACHAMP, we will be able to give them even more of a competitive edge, as we would like to bring in nutritionists and specialized work out programs to help them develop even quicker. As well, with the money donated, we will be able to bring these young men to tournaments outside of Montreal giving them experiences that you can only get as a team and family travelling

Corporate community partners including EFCO and Cox Health have shown their commitment to this project; we're excited to demonstrate community support to raise remaining funds.
Monett's City Park has a 9 hole disc golf course that ends on the opposite end of the park. This project will purchase materials for holes ten through eighteen and donate them to the City for installation. The current 9 hole course is well used; participation is up, and growing! Expanding the course will create a loop so that the 18th hole is close to the 1st, and increase the number of players that can be on the course at the same time. Together these will encourage and facilitate play.
It's important to us that healthy activities be accessible to all. That's one of the reasons we like disc golf and hope you'll support this project:
There are no fees to play, it's totally free and open to the public
All you need to start playing is a frisbee (and you can check them out at the Y for free)
If you can walk and throw a frisbee you can play disc golf.
By contributing, you are supporting the construction of a permanent installation. Your contribution will provide a healthy and fun activity for kids, adults, and families for years to come.
Projects costs total $3,934 for baskets, tee posts, and signs. Thanks to generous $1,500 donations from EFCO Corporation and Cox Health, we only need to raise $934; after the 5% administrative fee for Sportfunder and Paypal/Credit card fees, our campaign total comes to $1,009. Collaboration between corporate community partners and direct community support feels right. We're thankful to have the support of EFCO and Cox Health, and eager to demonstrate community enthusiasm for this project.

My name is Danielle Leigh Travis.  I was born and raised on the island of Maui and I've been crazy about playing polo since I was 16.
There is a high goal national tournament in Virginia I have been invited to play and I am turning to Sportfunder to raise the funds so I can play with my amazing team! My teammates are Megan Judge, Owner of Central Coast Polo Club. I have played in many tournaments with Megan and won. We play great together and I am so excited. My other teammate is Kirsten Ludwig, daughter of the great Rege Ludwig. We have all gotten our start in polo from playing in the arena and it's what we know best. We will go out there and win. This is an incredible opportunity. I am turning to Sportfunder because there may be a chance that I can get the support from you to go and compete in this national inaugural event! Both games will be streamed live on http://www.uspolo.org/
After highschool, I went to Santa Barbara City College where I was a three time All Star in collegiate arena polo, making it to Nationals my last year. After SBCC, I transferred to Texas Christian University where I also received an All Star award for my last year playing in college.
 Visit Youtube for a video of Danielle playing in the arena. https://youtu.be/Hhxgult9-Os
I love playing polo more than anything. It is my true passion. I am the first in my family to be playing polo and my family has been very supportive, and have helped me in the past financially but right now I need help.
*Boomie and I
You may have an idea that polo is just for the wealthy, and when I tell people I play polo they think I have a lot of money, but I don't. I own one horse, named Boomie, pictured above, that I bought off Craigslist and trained myself. I have owned her for the last 8 years and have been playing polo with her ever since. She has also received two best playing awards which is super awesome and rewarding.
Most polo players have a string of 4-6 horses to play a game. I have one horse so I have to rent horses to play an entire game which is very expensive.
MY RATING: I am currently rated a Women's 8 goals in the arena and 4 goals on the outdoor field. The rating system is on a scale from -2-10. My main goal for my polo career is to play as much as I can to improve to become one of the best women's polo players in the country.
 With my experience, I've been fortunate to have played as much polo as I have throughout the years. In order for me to get to my goal of being the best, I need to be playing in more tournaments against the toughest players.
*Last years Santa Barbara Women's Tournament: Winner and MVP
Right before graduation at TCU in 2010, I received great news that I was one of just two women chosen in the entire country to be a member of Team USPA, a national team. The United States Polo Association selects players who may not have the financial resources in order to give them more playing opportunities. I was required to move to Aiken, South Carolina to get the best training and be mentored by the best players in the world giving me the chance to play the best polo I've ever played. Unfortunately I couldn't stay there for too long as I needed to move  back home and start my career and make some money.
*Me playing on my mare Boomie on Maui in the Arena.
My journey of being a polo player has taught me so much about myself, and what mind set it takes to win. To become a world-class athlete I have to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more. I know I can do more and I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way onto a winner's podium.

To be able to reach these goals for this tournament I have to pay $4,000 for travel expenses, horse rental, housing and tournament fees. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund this tournament and you will be acknowledged for your support.
By contributing, you will help me reach my goals, but you will also take part in my  journey of becoming the 1st Women's US Open Arena Champion in the USA.
For those who know me as a player know what I am capable of doing, and know I am going to win. I can't go to Virginia in October without your help.
Aloha and Mahalo,
Danielle Leigh Travis

Before we go any further, I'd like to give you some background to this
fundraising project.

On 16 March 2019 the current owners of Milton Keynes Lightning ice
hockey team announced their intention to withdraw from the top tier
of British Ice Hockey - the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL).

This was surprising news for many supporters who probably
guessed that there were issues behind the scenes, but would
have at least liked the opportunity to have helped wherever possible.
The owners admitted that they should have talked to supporters
sooner but perhaps their pride had prevented them from doing so.

This hit many of us harder than we would have expected, mainly because
we are so invested in the hockey and our wonderfully passionate, supportive
hockey family.

Sadly, while the team fought valiantly on the ice, there was no opportunity
for the supporters to fight off the ice to retain Elite status - or so we thought.

As the season drew to a close, I held some initial and informal discussions with
key people. Very quickly it became apparent that there was a glimmer of hope
- a chance to maintain Elite Ice Hockey in Milton Keynes.

One of the early steps was to register a company (Milton Keynes Hockey Club
Limited) as a vehicle for this venture - this turned out to be a poorly kept secret
thanks to the eagle-eyed supporters out there.

To explore this further and to really get the ball rolling, I sought help from
supporters - the initial offers were, and continue to be; overwhelming.

The next step was to form an initial start-up board to put the foundations in
place - we appreciate that not everybody who offered help has been involved
up to now, but we had to keep the initial team small to move very quickly in what
is a very dynamic situation.

We are very fortunate and hugely grateful to the former NHL, SHL, EIHL and
Milton Keynes stalwart - Tim Wallace - who continues to provide invaluable
support in our planning to ice an Elite League team.

Conversations are taking place with the Elite League and we (the start-up board)
now need to demonstrate to them and other interested parties just how serious
we are about retaining Elite hockey in Milton Keynes. As you might expect, this
includes demonstrating a level of financial backing that will ensure we can start
the season and then build upon that as the weeks move on.

We have already secured in excess of £150,000 of funding, but to ensure stability,
we need to secure further money within two weeks.

We have explored how best to do this and sportfunder.com has proved to be
the most suitable approach. You will see that this also gives supporters the opportunity
to secure a reward in return for donations.

The letsplayhockey.org  campaign WILL REFUND DONATIONS if it is unsuccessful
in its bid to achieve Elite League hockey. In the event that this becomes necessary,
we will contact each backer by email - please ensure that you provide the correct
email address when donating.

Please note the following important points:
You will be charged at the time you donate
(not something we wanted to do, but this is
the only way this site operates).
 If you choose to donate anonymously, we will
not be able to refund your donation and you will
not receive any of the Founder Member rewards
(it is a little tricky if we don't know who you are).
 By all means hide your details from the public if
you wish, but please share it with us (the athlete)
- the options will be there when you donate.
 The ""Founder Member"" reward for donating is not
related to, and does not replace any membership
schemes run by Planet Ice, the Supporters Club or
any general membership schemes run in the future
by the hockey club 

We reserve the right to substitute elements of the
reward (with items of equivalent value).

So, having got this far through this ""summary"", we would like to thank
everyone who has expressed interest in helping, supporting and developing
this bid to save Elite League Ice Hockey in Milton Keynes.

As you will see from our website - http://www.letsplayhockey.org -  
our vision is very much built around the involvement of supporters,
not simply to raise funds but also in the very essence of the club,
its operation, events and future success.

If we can all work together, we really can achieve success on and off the ice.

Two years ago, I decided to establish a new goal in my life, someting that would help me overcome a fear of failure and insecurities that I had at that moment, so I signed up to my first half ironman.
My main goals this year are: to finish a full ironman, overcome my fear of swiming on open water, and overcome recent fears.
My journey of being a triathlete has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally.
My arrival to the finish line was a emotional but heart broken experience, people who i loved didn't believed in me and didn't supported me. I would've loved to see them on the finish line.
Even though, this race helped me to realise who were the important people in my life, and that if I wanted to do something I have the control to make it happen, since then, I've been afraid of engaging on new goals, since I'm afraid I won't be supported and I feel like I could loose people I love.
Now, I want more, I know I can do more. I want to loose this fear of thinking that I can't or that something bad could happen,  am ready to push my limits!
To be able to reach these goals this year I have to pay at least $3,000, for the inscription and traveling. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my fees.

A long way of recovery in Lombok is still going on slowly - while buildings can be build back, people spirits cant be raised back so easily.
Looking through a sad landscape left after nature's roar, our team felt a necessity to SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITY THROUGH SPORTS.
Through teaching people main philosophies of Aikido we want to bring NEW HOPES to those who suffered, to make them FEARLESS AND STRONG to bare difficulties that community is facing in recovery times.

At the moment our team have a place ready to accommodate first practitioners and experienced Sensei cant wait to share the knowledge.
We are just one issue away from opening our doors to public!
Our Dojo NEEDS SUPPORT TO BUY MORE MATS for preventing injures during education. The cost of tick Aikido mats inclusive shipment to Lombok is $1000 and this sum is hard to get for us.

We are reaching out for you to take part in not just supporting sports but contributing for community spirit of earthquake victims.
Children deserve a chance to fight against their fears, adults have to find new hopes and doubt in tomorrow - and you can help with it!

Our target is to get funded $1000 so we can start classes immediately once mats arrive.
Our long-term goal is to open a separate big Dojo complex with daily classes, able to host Aikido Seminars with worldwide participants.

Looking back you might get a reasonable question why we founding for building Aikido Dojo, once its seems to be more logic to help in building houses and other institutions.
Unfortunately the sector of sport, physical and emotional support is always been forgotten in privilege for first-need aids. But there will be no progress if human's spirit is down.
Aikido is a way of a warrior and this way begins from your head, your heart and your soul.  

You can join this Budo (warrior) way by contributing for our needs!
We are excited to ask you join a way of recovery and rebuilding of wonderful Lombok Island!

I am working hard to become a top level athlete with my ultimate goal to be to get to the CrossFit games in the USA in the age related divisions.
This competition however, is for masters, and puts me against the best people of my age and ability in Oceania and beyond. 
Last year I gained a third position on the podium in NZ for the soldier division, this year I hope to do better. 
I've been training hard and feel ready to take on this challenge, which is made even more difficult by the fact that it has been interrupted by Covid and now I am the only one making the trip from my gym.
I need to raise money to get there, the cost of living is fairly high at the moment and I run a business and have various other projects. I have to give up time to train to achieve my goals, which I realise is a privilege most aren't able to do. However it does mean my business income is less as I lose a few hours during the day to training.
I am now an apprentice personal trainer and am passionate about being an ambassador for older athletes and those who have a huge fitness journey ahead of them.",6.0,2.0,3.0,15.0,4.0,7.0

I was born with spina bifida. I have always defeated the odds that were not in my favor. I have a great talent in playing wheelchair sports and I excelled in a number of sports such as wheelchair rugby and wheelchair racing.
in 2015 I joined a Wheelchair Rugby Club called The MustangsWCR. The team then went on time winning the WCR_SA league 4 years running now. It is in this team I explored other sports and fell  in love with the sport of wheelchair racing with all my heart. The only down fall that hinders me from perusing this sport is the lack of equipment and funds to get started. I am writing this letter to ask for assistance in terms of funding to acquire a Top End Racing Wheelchair + all necessary parts$6,000USD and a new daily wheelchair $4,000USD RGK Tiga FX. 
I have already been classified as a T54 athlete for track events. T54 is a disability sport classification for disability athletics in the track events. The class includes people with spinal cord injuries who compete using a wheelchair in track events.  
I have never seen my disability as a stumbling block to reaching my aspirations. I am a highly motivated and extremely determined in whatever goals I set for myself and I shall never rest until I achieve this milestone of bring a medal back home to Lesotho.
My disability is my ability, and I will not let life as I know it end without reaching my hearts desires for 2020. Life is too short to not follow your dreams, so with this campaign I'm asking that everyone helps me realize this dream of mine.
 Please help me become the best of what my country offers.

Phakoa Mashape.

We are raising funds to cover the costs of purchasing a second Porter Volleyball net system and additional volleyballs. Our current net is ancient, it is almost 20 yrs. old! We would like to upgrade the current system and add another to our facility.
Volleyball is the most popular girls sport in America and we are one of the few schools that has a middle school volleyball program.This game teaches players to be respectable teammates and how to think about the group as a whole, not just as individuals. Even better, players learn to be joyful for one another’s successes as they grasp how it benefits the team overall.
With YOUR support the extra equipment will help our female athletes. Since, our gym is a multi-use facility players have done whatever it takes to become better. This has been achieved through practicing almost anywhere we can, from a baseball field to a beach court. Additionally, time constraints are present having one (1) net and three teams. The upgrade to a second net would make the facility usage easier and allow for the program to generate more volleyball opportunities as the majority of groups, programs, camps, and colleges require two nets for hosting events.

I is my hope that I continue to progress and some day achieve my dream of representing Canada for judo at the Olympics.

This coming Nationals is very important to me. I have trained very hard the last couple of years in an effort to medal at nationals. Despite my perseverance, I have struggled the last couple of years at tournament, usually losing to people who bigger and better then me. However, lately I have had a lot of success and also got invited to join the Judo Ontario High Preformance Program team. I was so glad to finally see that all of my hard word is starting to pay off.

Thank you for taking the time to view our campaign. This is our fundraiser for the two trips we are taking this year (The Hoopsville Classic in Stevenson, Maryland and the Dayton Beach Shootout in Daytona Beach, Florida) an enhanced JV schedule, and facility enhancements.  
At these events we are playing two teams, Christopher Newport (#4) and Whitman (#7), that finished in the top 10 in the country last year. We are also playing Wesleyan University and Albright College, two good programs that are challenging games for us. We are adding games to our JV schedule this year in order to provide our young players with even more experience as well. We have a young group that we are very excited about. This is huge for us with 8 returning sophomores and 8 freshman. In addition, we are looking at making improvements to our facility to create an even better game day environment! 
One of the reasons we are making these trips is due to your tremendous support! If we want to play top competition, we have to go find it because no one wants to come play in the crazy place our supporters, like you, create at Fenton Court.  Check out that environment below:
That's a great problem to have, but it also means we need your financial support to develop the type of program we want and go play the competition we need to achieve our goal - to bring a National Championship home to Marietta.
You can contribute to an individual athlete or you can contribute to the team campaign, the choice is up to you. Regardless of the amount of your contribution you will be helping the Marietta College Men's Basketball team tremendously and we’ll be grateful to you. We know how instrumental the support of our community and friends has been to our continued success and appreciate every ounce of help we receive.

When it comes to hip hop dance, there is so much talent in the Philippines. We have witnessed how dance can change lives and keep our kids off the streets. Life in the Philippines is difficult, and very different from most developed countries. There is little support for the arts as Filipinos struggle to make ends meet on a daily basis. We earn barely enough to get by. But despite these challenges, we have witnessed our community grow. Slowly, we are starting to gain the respect and support of a society that's bred to believe that pursuing dance will get you no where. Slowly, we are proving them wrong. 

But we still have a long way to go. Help us bring home the gold for our country once again. We need to raise over $17,000 simply to cover registration and accommodations in Las Vegas, USA for a team of forty (40) members (excluding airfare, meals, and transfers).

As athletes, it is our dream to be able to compete at the highest level of competition, and in Jiu-Jitsu that is the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu World Champiosnhips. It is a very important dream for most BJJ practitioners and that is why it has become our goal to send the largest contingent of Filipino Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners to the World Championships. We would like to be able to share the dream with as many of our hardworking and competitive team mates and countrymen.
I will be using the funds for:
Majority of the funds will go to ticket fares of the competitors. That is the biggest challenge to being able to compete in the US…the expensive price of the plane tickets. After we have made sure that the tickets of the competitors are funded, we will then focus on finding suitable lodging for everyone in the team. Lastly, we will be dividing the rest for food allowance.
Your contribution means:
Our country is never in short supply of tragedy. It's either a bad typhoon, an earthquake, or a war between the government and rebels. The only time Filipinos are able to rejoice as a country is when one of us is able to achieve the feat of winning. Look at Manny Pacquiao, the crime rate goes down when he fights and love for country and neighbor is so thick you can almost touch it. The same way when our football team or basketball team advances to the semis or finals in a tournament. Happiness fills the air, media is positive and work becomes easier. We would like to be able to give our country the same thing, but this time through Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Imagine. We have had success before as a very small team. A team of 3 people. May Masuda was able to win the country's first ever Gold Medal at White Belt and Alvin Aguilar was able to win the country's first ever Black Belt Match. Imagine what we can do as a bigger contingent.

I am currently ranked 2nd in Spain for speed windsurfing and 5th in Europe. My main goal this year is to be able to beat the amateur Spanish Speed Record and get close to the 50 knots barrier for speed windsurfing.
My journey of being a Windsurfer has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I have been competing in Bonaire, Canary Islands, France, Defi , where I learned so much more about my sport. To become a world-class athlete I had to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way onto a podium.
To be able to reach these goals this year I have to pay 30000 € so I can manage some new equipment to be competitive and also to travel where speed competitions happen (France, Bonaire, Fuerteventura and the World record breaking place in Namibia.. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my fees.

Ever since it was founded, the team has mainly be formed by students from university students from all over the city, being our average team age around the 23 years old.
We compete in the Mexican National Xv's and 7's tournament.
As there's no other teams to play with in the state, we have to travel to our games, for at least, 4 hours (nearest city with another team is Cancun). One game is a representative expense for each of our players, and continuously we find ourselves in struggle to complete the team. 
During our first season, we manage to find someone to make us our uniforms, but as rugby is not a well known sport in Mexico, they weren't made strong enough, reason why we have around 22 jerseys left, full of holes, and ripping one more off every game. 
Our practices are held at a public sports park, were we found half of a children soccer field free 2 days of the weeek, which now is mainly dust and rocks, and sometimes we gotta share it with other local sports teams that have no proper place to practice either.
As I said in the begining, our economics do not represent our strongest card,  but is hasn't stopped us of playing a game, even with no subs and ripped out uniforms.
We are a growing team, with most of our players learing about how great is rugby in their 20's, and with a long and bright future ahead of us. 
We would love you to help us getting some proper jerseys, and paying a rent for a proper field to practice at. We lack of equipment (dumies, scrum machine, etc), but we are willing to improve and get better every day.
Last 2 years, we manage to reach the 4th and 6th place in the National MexSevens Ranking. We are sure we can get to the top just with  a bit of help.

My name is Nathan Gardner and I am from Lynchburg, VA. Basketball is the one sport I truly love and am passionate about. My main goals are to grow in this sport with the hopes that one day play at the college level. To truly grow, I need your help to move my dream into a reality.
I currently play travel basketball. Playing travel ball has allowed me to continuously work hard and move towards my personal goal, but the road to success is costly. The funds that I raise go towards my team fees, a new uniform, travel costs and competition fees.  By supporting me today, you are investing into something bigger than just a fundraiser. You're changing my life.  Please consider helping me continue to play travel; this is where it all begins!

I have completed IM70.3 x2 this year and qualified for the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii in October 2017. Unfortunately, I missed the Able-Bodied combined Swim/Bike Cut-Off by 1:51 minutes and had a DNF. Less than six weeks later, I raced at Ironman Cozumel in November and set a new world record time for a hand cycling female. My main goal the 2018 season is to qualify for Kona again and become World Champion.
My journey of being an Ironman has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself both physically and mentally. I've had to learn to relinquish my staunch independence at times and ask for help, but the Triathlon Community has been so incredibly supportive! 
To become a world-class athlete I've had to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline, as well as self-funding all my training and racing. After many years as a Para-Cyclist, ranked consistently in the top five in the world, my Ironman journey has only just begun. I know that I can do even better next year and I'm aiming for a Podium finish in Hawaii.
To be able to reach this goals this year I have to pay £1227.33 to travel to my qualifying race in Luxembourg in June 2018. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my entry and travel costs.

$2,500 - lighting repairs *many times the older kids play at sundown to allow the younger kids to be done before dark and maintain their needed schedule

My name is Jalen La'Mar Henry and I am a ninth grader from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA. I am the oldest of 3 brothers and live with my mother. I am truly passionate about Wrestling! After trying many sports that coaches and people said I was just too small for, I finally found something that I was naturally good at!
I'm smart, strong and eager to learn techniques and skills to help me excel to the next level and ultimately earn a scholarship to attend college. I exercise everyday, drink water and eat healthy. I watch videos that my coach sends us and search youtube videos for tips and skills to help me be a better wrestler. My goal is to become one of the best athletes in my sport and my weight class, and I need your help to turn the impossible into a reality.
To excel, I need to be constantly push my limits. I am ready to work hard, but at the same time, I know that the road to success will be very costly with skill, competition and summer camps...also traveling to and fro. By supporting me today, you are investing into something bigger than just a fundraiser. You are truly changing my life in so many ways. I will be grateful for any amount.

We are already back in the pool working hard (this time with the help of a coach!) and are excited to be beginning our journey back to CUSSL Nationals!

Unfortunately we are not recognized by our university's athletics department, which means that the costs of our pool time, registration fees, bathing suits, and travel come directly out of our pockets. We have been very lucky to have the support of the London Synchro Club in welcoming us into the club and sharing their pool time and administrative resources with us. However, as we are all on student budgets, the costs of travel and accommodation at competitions add up very quickly! 
This year, CUSSL Nationals are being held in Vancouver in February. The flights for 10 swimmers and 1 coach from London to Vancouver and our accommodation in Vancouver will cost much more than our usual travel expenses, so we need your help to get there!

Any money donated will go directly to our travel costs. If you can't donate, be sure to share this to help spread the word about our campaign!

My journey as a cricketer has taught me much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I've been to national competitions, where I've learned much about my sport. To become a county cricketer I've had to push my personal and physical limits. The thing is, I want to be even better and fulfil my full potential. I'm ready to push myself even further and work my way to an England call-up.
To be able to reach these goals I need to attend a £15,000 6-month professional training programme at the world famous Darren Lehmann Australian Cricket Academy.

A lot of people don't realize how expensive training and competing really is, and how little income is actually made. Over a season an athlete in this sport can spend up to amount for training and competition, and only make amount in prize money. So as the math shows, each season as an athlete you dive deeper into a pool of debt. That being said, I've not done this sport for the money, but for the love.
With money raised through MAKEACHAMP, I will be able to train and compete free of the worry and stress that finances play.

We are a group of professionals embarked in a new adventure through Soccer/Football and the importance it has in my country. My main goals this year are:
Set up a location of our own to help us develop our activities using soccer as means to change our community for the better.
Set up a competitive First Team Side and win our own division.
Our journey of being in charge for the Club has taught us so much about ourselves, such as our strengths and weaknesses, and how hard we can push ourselves and others to use Soccer/Football as a tool to better our society and give more opportunities to people with less resources. We are professionals that have been to in England, finishing an MBA in Sports Management in Spain and have Football Coaching License from our local Federation, where we learned so much more about the sports industry. To become a world-class Club we had to push our limits and develop incredible self-discipline, communication skills and leadership abilities. The thing is, we want more, we know we can do more. We are ready to push our limits and the limits of the people around us to even further our common goal we know that we can work our way onto a podium.

To be able to reach these goals this year we need US$ 10,000,000. This money will be used to set up the housing, school, training facilities and a proper living space for the children that will be part of our club. Also this money will be used to support the expenses of the first year of activities. All donations will directly help us fund our fees. By contributing you will help us reach our goals but you will also take part in our journey of changing a community and giving more children and young adults options and a chance of a better life through sport.",5.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,2.0,7.0

 RFA Values
The Academy has a number of core values that cascade down from the Chairperson, The Board of Directors, and The Management to all players, staff and supporters. The Club always tries to ensure that all values are upheld, and that it is always striving to increase and add to those core values.

To help us reach our goals in presenting top electronic sport athletes on the world stage, fight for medals on the international circuit, and have the means to do so.
The average cost of a season for a top athlete is approximately £25,000, and that doesn't including living expenses. Most athletes are responsible for covering expenses to attend all the necessary training camps, train year-round, travel and accommodation, competition entry fees, facility fees, and equipment, amongst other things.
By contributing, you are supporting Legion Gaming as an organisation and its athletes. You are also becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, that is helping young athletes reach their dreams and achieve athletic excellence in a digital age. Being a part of Legion Gaming is a big step forward in an athlete's development, and we believe we can take them to the next level.
We are asking for your support and to help spread the word! Please team up with us!",3.0,0.0,3.0,11.0,1.0,14.0

I have been to many competitions where I learned so much more about my sport. To become a world-class athlete I had to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline.

 Our names are Anastasia Zalomajeva and Victoria Stenclava. And our biggest passion is to play beach tennis!
 Beach tennis is a sport with a high potential, it also will be an Olympic sport by the year of 2024. And our dream is to represent Latvian national team during these Olympic games.
 Right now, Anastasija is 15 and Victoria – 16 years old. And we are the first Latvian junior team which was playing at European championship U18 and U14 (Latvia is a part of top-10 junior teams of the world).
 What lies ahead for us - is the most responsible moment – transition to play adult tournaments where competition is increasing all the time.
 Right now, in the international rating of ITF, we have 304th and 405th position and we are pushing all our effort to successfully participate in all tournaments which are located in Latvia and countries around. But it’s still not enough for the required progress.
 Our dream is to participate in the best beach tennis tournament – Aruba beach tennis open, which annually takes place at Aruba from 11 till 18 of November. This is the only world tournament, which includes all the categories and happens during the whole week.  We are planning to play:
·      single tournament in the PRO category
·      Double tournaments for adults ITF 35000$
·      Adult mix ITF 35000$
·      Team tournament, where we are planning to represent Latvia
·      Junior tournament U18
·      Junior tournament in the age category U16 – which we are aiming to win!
Tournament at Aruba – is a chance for us to play against the top players in the adult games, gain an experience in the games with the high-quality players who represent different world countries. And gain scores for our international rating positions. As well as, check our abilities at the junior tournament.
 In the next season, we are planning to focus on adult professional tournaments. For the next season, our starter games will be European and World junior championships.
 We really need a help from each of you! We are kindly asking to help us make it happened – so we can visit our dream tournament! But from our side we promise to work hard and put a lot of effort!
  Let’s make our Latvian junior team unbeatable together!   ",11.0,1.0,3.0,15.0,0.0,10.0

It truly is a team sport and we strive to build the strength within our team week in and week out.  We would love to have you join up with us for the remainder of the 2018 racing season.
The average cost of a season for TGR is approximately $10,000, and that doesn't include travel expenses. So to get us through seasons end, we have balanced our needs down to our minimum.
By contributing, you are supporting Team Guy Racing as an organization and its drivers as individuals. You are also becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, which is helping young drivers reach their dreams and achieve racing excellence. Being a part of the Team Guy Racing is a big step forward in diversity, and we believe we can take them to the next level.  
In addition, 10% of all funds raised will be donated to the Epilepsy Foundation of Nevada.  This foundation is near and dear to our heart as a race team.  Cameron was diagnosed with epilepsy in October 2017.  He missed most of the 2017 racing season.  Because of his wonderful neurologist and his constant support, Cameron has been able to participate in something that he probably would not be able to do.  Our hope is to contribute to the research that is needed in order to help other families realize that with the support of good people, you can do what you set your mind out to do.

I am computer science student. Besides study, I am a keen of mountaineering and ice climbing. I spend most of my vacations in trekking and climbing areas of Pakistan. I had attempted Ansu Lake trek, which is on 13000ft altitude, and I had succeeded.
I want to attempt Malika Parbat peak , which 5290m high. I have also kept Concordia- K2 Base camp, in my Que.  
My campaign goals:
This summer I want to reach camp 1 of Malika Parbat peak. I'll try to ascend from advance base camp and push for the C1.

I'm raising funds for:
Malika Parbat expedition.
Why I need your support:
I have no financial support from my parents, for climbing or mountaineering, as it is an expensive sport. Its equipment is costly than others.
I need money for even basic tools used for climbing, like Ice Axe, Crampons, Harness, and carabiner. ",2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,4.0

My name is James Mwaura and I am from Kenya. I am truly passionate about Cycling, which I train as often as I can. My goal is to become one of the greatest athletes in the history  my sport, and I need your help to turn the impossible into a reality.
I am a professional extreme cyclist who is hoping to champion in the 2020 Trans-Siberian extreme race, the longest and most extreme bicycle race in the world, the race will be taking place in Russia as from 23rd of June to 17th of July 2020.
 I need the weight of the public to help raise funds to participate in this amazing race. The expenses for participation are really steep and the fact that i have no sponsors, makes it really difficult to participate in this major race. I heard about Sportfunder and decided it will be a great way to raise some funds for the race. Any amount will go a long way to achieving my dream of participating in the race; I will also be making history by being THE FIRST BLACK MAN/FIRST KENYAN to participate in the Trans-Siberian extreme race. So it is really personal for me.
Also, you can support me by sharing my campaign with your friends and family. You can do that by sharing the campaign link via social media, email or any messaging application. On behalf of my entire team, i will like to thank you all in advance.  ",7.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,2.0,9.0

As part of the Canadian delegation these athletes will travel to Helsinki Finland in July of 2015 and showcase their routine and performances on the world stage.
Gymnaestrada is on the non-competitive side of gymnastics, developing skills that carry over into all sports. It promotes the value and diversity of gymnastics and celebrates a passion for being active for life. World Gymnaestrada is also one of the largest sporting events held in the world with anticipated number of athletes attending reaching upwards of 24,000! Countries from around the world will have athletes performing and showcasing their talents. For our team this will be a cultural sporting event second to none and will undoubtedly be a trip of a lifetime for them.
I will be using the funds for:
Attending any National or International sporting event comes at a cost ... $4000 per athlete to be exact! Registration fees will be $1600 - $1800, travel expenses $2000 and another $200- $400 will be needed for food and special events not covered in the registration fees.

Rowing in South Africa
Rowing is a sport globally recognized for the dedication, commitment and tenacity of its participants, as hundreds of hours of preparation both on, and off, the water are needed to succeed in a race that can take as little as six minutes. Athletes pride themselves on the meticulous nature of their preparation, knowing that a 2000 meter race can be won or lost by just centimeters.
Rowing is the fastest growing sport in South Africa, coming off the back of Olympic Gold in 2012, Silver in 2016 and multiple World Champions in between.
Predominantly seen as a ‘private school’ sport, the tenacity of the state schools, such as Jeppe High School for Boys, taking part is evident, as smaller, less-funded clubs continue to punch above their weight.
Rowing at Jeppe High School for Boys
Jeppe High School for Boys has a rich rowing history. Formed under the auspices of the Wemmer Pan Rowing Club in the early 1950’s, Jeppe High School for Boys Rowing Club went on to become the first official schools rowing club in South Africa in 1953.
From humble beginnings, the club has grown and developed, with expected ups and downs, to its current state. Along the way, the school has achieved many accolades, most notably a large number of SA representatives.
The rich history and tradition our rowing club is one that is respected and revered within South African rowing circles.

The SASRU Junior Development Policy
ROWSA (Rowing South Africa) and SASRU (South African Schools Rowing Union) recognises that schools and clubs play an important role in the identification and development of junior rowers. So as to increase the standard of rowing at u19 level and increase medal prospects at the FISA Junior World Championships, the exposure of school rowers to whom this policy applies to international regattas of high standard is desirable.
ROWSA has sanctioned the undertaking of a ""U16 Development Tour"" by SASRU as set out below to those international regattas as determined by SASRU in consultation with the chairman of ROWSA’s International Commission (“IC”) each year (“the tour”).

CAMPAIGN",,Paint Ball,hello everyone  my name is lee alexander crossland (19)  i want to take you through my life as a paintballer and the tears of success and failure i have stood through throughout the years i have played +i started playing paintball when i was 12 years of age with a bunch of my school friends  after my first experience of playing the sport  i swore never to touch a paintball marker (gun) again as the pain was to immense for my sake  but after my friend convinced me to tag along with him and others  i started to become fonder of the sport and as i always do  i read up on something before committing to it  with the information i gathered  i came across a more complex style of paintball known as speedball  speedball is a faster and more adrenaline pace of paintball  where two teams battle it out to see who is victorious  by using electronic markers  electronic hoppers and unique apparel suited for the situation  in 2013 i had convinced my dad to buy me a bushball marker  so i could mess around in the bush with my friends  one day on my way to school i heard on the radio hat a team  well known as dynamix had won the championship in singapore  which got me all excited  but as i still mentioned above  i was too scared to take on the challenge of playing speedball even though it looked astonishing  after playing a year of bushball  with my own marker  i had done some more in depth researched about speedball and the one day i took my friends paintballing  a lady convinced me to try speedball  from there i was hooked paintball  2015 after being convinced to give speedball a try  i finally bought my first ever electronic marker  planet eclipse etha  it was such an amazing experience for me as i had always loved fast actioned sports  after browsing through facebook  i came across a page called ‘sarpl  south african regional paintball league’ where i would find that every month events were hosted at different paintball fields  i had managed to convince my friends to buy markers and give it a go  although i did not understand any of the rules of the game and what the different divisions meant  i just registered and hoped for the best  after my first tournament  i realised that the sport/ league was a bit expensive and for me to continue i would become a manager of my own team and gather players to help with funding  from there it began  i created a team named stretch poison and we were off to a promising start  after numerous amounts of practice  i received a message from a fellow paintballer influencing me to try a new league out whilst i got into the sport  sanpl  south african national paintball league  this was exactly like the sarpl  but more for the fun of the game  with all the training from the best paintballers south africa had to offer  we were ready to take on the league  every month an event would be hosted which would allow us to partake in for a minimum sum of money  the team gathered up some funding and we headed off to show our competitors we were new but deadly  at the end of the year we had been a lethal team amonst our rivals and all the effort finally paid off  we had managed to finish first in the league which was a huge achievement as this was only our first year of competitive paintball  not to forget  i had almost managed to obtain ‘player of the day’ in our final tournament   paintball  2016 in 2016 stretch poison decided to move back to the more elite and more acknowledged league known as the sarpl  in our first event for the year we managed to acquire a podium finish  which helped set our journey throughout the league  with numerous podium finishes and medals we were a force to be reckoned with  but unfortunately due to funding of players  the team started to disperse  and new members had to be brought in  this did not ruin our goal to become one of the best teams in south africa  but it did take a toll on us as we did struggle through some events  at the end of the year we participated in the annual supercup  where teams from across the continent and world would come and see who the best team in the league is  during the annual tournament  stretch poison looked strong  but unfortunately  we did not manage to make it through to the quarter finals which left the team wondering if they should stay or leave to another team  paintball  2017 in the beginning of 2017 i had decided to leave the team as it was falling apart  and i wanted to expand my skill level in the higher level the league had to offer  i was approached by challenger’s division team named tag  where i would play with them till the end of the year  2017 was a phenomenal year for me as not only did i manage to play higher grade paintball  but i was also selected to represent gauteng for the under 19’s squad  where we would go to cape town and bring home the golden trophy  with the result of being selected for the u19’s i had managed to obtain my provincial colours for paintball  in paintball there was always a challenge i had to face  the financial challenge  moving up divisions are always good for every player as your skill level develops even further but moving up also becomes more expensive which was a huge dilemma for me at the time  luckily my teammates were supportive and helped me with my funding  at the end of the year i was approached by my all time favourite team  a team i had looked up to from 2015  patriots  they questioned me if i wanted to join them for the end of 2017 and beginning 2018 season  which i could have never declined the offer  i joined patriots and results have been fantastic since  paintball  2018+since the beginning of the 2018 season my dreams have come true  joining my all time favourite team patriots and being selected to represent south africa in the u19’s world cup in paris   the year started off with a high note as my team patriots have manged to make podium at every event and even though the year is not over  we are sitting second in the log  this has probably been the best year of paintball for me since i began to play as i have ranked up to the highest division in south africa  and the best part about it is that all the people/players i used to look up to  look up to me too  sponsorship +like i have mentioned above  this year has truly been extraordinary  and i am hoping someone can make my dream a reality by helping me get to paris to represent my country and help me obtain my national colours for paintball  i would be honoured if someone could help me achieve my dream  please help me get to paris  as it would be

We are located in Jersey City Heights. For the 2017-2018 cheer season, there are four teams that range from ages 18 and under. These are exceptional young athletes who put in countless hours to reach their goals. The process is long. It takes patience, perseverance, and a very dedicated athlete, parent, coach and organization to make for a successful season!
This season, we are truly excited to announce that our Youth level 2 ""Lightning"" team has just earned a bid invitation to compete at one of the most prestigious competition in the cheerleading world, the D2 Summit at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. Bids are given only to the best scoring teams and it is a huge accomplishment in itself to receive one. These young ladies have had an impressive season taking home 1st place in numerous competitions. They are passionate, dedicated and it shows.  
The girls are so excited to attend and, as the cost to participate is expensive and prohibitive for some families, we are putting together a number of fundraising efforts to mitigate the cost of travel, accommodation and competition entry fees amongst other expenses.  
We want to team up with you to help us reach our goals in representing our community when we take the stage at the D2 Summit!
Our mission is simple. Empower young children, especially young girls by fostering their self-esteem, the value of team work, developing their leadership skills, supporting positive and healthy decisions, and encouraging overall excellence.

My name is Jamieson Stone and I am from Jackson, WY, USA. I am extremely passionate about skiing. My goal is to share my love of Freeride skiing through films and photography. As well as showcasing my skiing creatively,  I also actively compete in big mountain freeride competitions as well as many other ski competitions. My background in skiing comes from a skiing racing. Ski racing was my sport for many years, I pushed my limits in this sport to the max; competing in FIS-U (NCAA) and NORAM circuits. I sustained a few injuries that made me rethink decisions; thus ultimately leading me to re-find my love of skiing. I found it way up in the mountains away from the race course. I now strive to inspire other skiers and athletes through shorts films and eventually bigger production films.
The cost of skiing in general is a lot, let alone traveling across the globe in search of new, different, and possibly  un-skied locations. Any help you can offer will be greatly appreciated; and your name will apear in the credits of each film that your donation is used to fund.

My name is James and I am from a small village in the Scottish Highlands, called Boat of Garten. I am truly passionate about Rugby, having played from the age of 3 at Highland Rugby Football Club and trained religiously for the last 13 years.
On my rugby journey so far I have played for my school; Grantown Grammar School, my club; Highland Rugby Football Club, my region; Caledonia, the Glasgow Warriors and I had just been selected to play in the Under 16's Scotland Blues team when the programme was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
My campaign goals:
Despite the challenges of the pandemic, my goal is still to become one of the best athletes in my sport but to excel, I need to be constantly pushing my limits. I believe one of the best chances of making it is by attending a US college, where rugby is one of their fastest growing sports, and playing in the Division 1 Varsity league.
I just need your help to turn the impossible into a reality.
I'm raising funds for:
Through Elite Rugby Scholars I have been offered an incredible sports scholarship to Mount St Mary's University. I am ready to work hard but, at the same time, I know the road to success will be costly. The funds raised will help to support my board and accommodation costs; around £10,000 per year, whilst I complete my studies.
Why I need your support:
Your contribution will help me chase my dream of becoming a professional rugby player. By supporting me today, you are investing in something much bigger than just a fundraiser, you're changing my life.

My name is Jay Banlasan and I've been a basketball player for as long as I can remember.
I am not that great, just average but I don't give up easily. A player's heart is measured by the strength of his spirit. I believe basketball isn't just a physical game but spiritual too. The game is over the moment your spirit is broken and has long surrendered.
I was new to the city 3 years ago and has been looking for a great league to get into. Being an active player from a faraway town, my body has always longed for the game. I think that's how I can say that I really love basketball. I have been part of different leagues, different teams, but there is a longing in my heart that I didn't understand. I thought It was just the desire to win and win more.
I've been into different local competitions, I won some, I lost some. And there is nothing great about losing trust me, even if they tell you it's okay. No, as a player, It really hurts and the pain sips to your bones. I know this feeling really well. I always have been competitive and my drive to win always shows when I'm on the court, I just hate losing.
But even if I win and win there is still that void inside me. I only finally understood what it was when I started managing a team. It's a different kind of joy when you are the directing force.
So this year, my team got into an open league. And even if my body is not getting younger, plus I had my fair share of injuries and might retire from being active soon, I still Will Never Give Up basketball. I will be a player-coach on our upcoming league but I need your support. I am not doing this for myself but for the young ones whom I can see myself too. I want to give my best for them and even provide them with the best jersey - an ironman themed one.
To be able to reach this goal I have to raise $1000. All donations will directly help me fund my team's jersey and other in-game expenses, water and court fees. (We live in the Philippines so you can imagine.) By contributing you will help me boost the teams Moral and confidence and also take part in our journey (I can send the donors photos if you want).

My journey of being a sprinter has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I have been to turkey as an athlete and i was invited by athlete federation of Nigeria for world championship trial where I learned so much more about my sport. To become a world-class athlete I had to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way onto a podium.

There is little attention given to grassroots sports development in Nigeria, so I thought I should develop a platform that allows the real grassroots aged 11 to 19 years old develop their sporting abilities.
My team and I have put a lot of work into developing a platform that allows kids learn and develop aptitude for sports. In Nigeria, only kids that are exceptional get a chance to participate in sports tournaments. These tournaments are rarely developmental because they are not regular. Our solution basically addresses the issues of affordability, regularity and opportunities for all to participate. We focus on 6 career oriented sports such as soccer, basketball, athletics, etc. We host up to 20 teams on a sports facility every Saturday and give equal opportunities to all kids through a league that runs for 10 weeks. The kids are exposed to 6 different sports over 3 academic trimesters which allows every child the opportunity to participate in 3 sports every academic year.
We started the pilot phase with a soccer season after securing a field in a public school. Much work still has to be done to provide fantastic amenities for the kids to play. And that's why we need about $12,500 to put the sports facility in modest order to ensure other sporting events can be facilitated.
To be able to sustain our mission without having to seek funds always, we implemented a match day fee of about 50 cents to help us maintain the facility.

Most of them were coached and distinctively chosen to be part of a non -profit organization in their primary school years, namely Kouga Cricket Performance Centre (KCPC) (registration number 150-114NPO.  We are so proud of KCPC for their role in mentoring and coaching the boys which has resulted in them developing into the cricket players they are today.
They have enormous potential and many of them have been selected for their respective provincial cricket teams in the past. 
The tour costs are split into instalments and the deposits are due by the 31 October 2018 and the final payment is due by end of  April 2019.  The total cost per player is approximately R40 000",3.0,0.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,12.0

But challenge is what's moving us forward.

In February of 2019 we have started a football club in Rijeka, Croatia. Our first goal was to obtain all the necessary equipment and we did it using our own personal funds. We have soon started competing in Croatian Flag Football League which was a great honor and even greater organizational challenge.
Along with the entry fee for this competition and with the costs of our transport to tournaments, our personal investments in the club exceeded 1000 euros just in the first three months. As a newly formed club, we didn't have any sponsors.

And now we stand on the beginning of a new chapter of football in our town and on our region. Our plan is to compete for the playoffs this year and we plan to start a female and a junior team. Therefore, we need new equipment, specifically new jerseys for our senior and for newly planned female and junior teams. Furthermore, greater expectations and bigger league mean that our training (we have to rent the training pitch or hall) and transportation costs (we're traveling to 6 different tournaments, roughly 2500km) are going to be a lot bigger.

become a part of it!
McMaster Dragon Boat has participated in regional and international race festivals for over 10 years and we've only improved since the inception. Here's what you need to know about us:
We're a student-led group, led by a team of 10 full-time students with 75 members!
We are a non-profit organization, financed through our personal fundraising efforts
So what are we campaigning for and why are we worth your time and support?

As with many team sports, dragon boat is not cheap. Between our fundraising efforts and team fees during the off-season, we have been able to raise enough money to finance our weekly practices and annual race festival entry fees. Your support will support our dragon boating experiences far into the future and help us become an even more prominent team in the dragon boating world!

Our campaign will be tiered to achieve five off-water dreams. Once we've raised the amount per tier, we will make a purchase and proceed onto the next tier!
TIER 1: TEAM BANNERS ($300): Currently, our banners are cotton, hand-painted fabrics that we hang above our site at races (Pictured here: http://bit.ly/1iNbnRo). The new banners we're hoping to get will be custom, digitally designed and printed onto outdoor, vinyl plastic (perfect to last through the sun, wind and rain!)
TIER 2: OUTDOOR TARP ($85): Speaking of rain... On race days, when Mother Nature decides to shed her tears, our team creates makeshift shelter by trying to hang our tarp to trees (Pictured here: http://bit.ly/1iIZhih). These multi-functional tarps also serve as nice picnic mats for the whole team to sit together. Previously, our tarps were supplied by members who personally own them, but once they're up in trees, everyone is just standing under them! The funds raised will be enough to purchase two large pieces of outdoor tarp measuring 16'x30' and 10'x20'.
TIER 3: TEAM TENT ($300): Instead of trying to tie tarp to the trees and standing under them, investing in a pop-up tent will at least keep our towels and clothes dry while we stand out in the rain! It's also usefu for hanging up our wet clothes to dry or hiding from Mr. Sun.
TIER 4: PRACTICE EQUIPMENT BAG ($70): During our off season, our team practices on the side of the McMaster swimming pool with used equipment. The paddles are stored in a very run down paddle bag that has been patched up over the years with duct tape. Help us replace the paddle bag, and possibly get some new paddles for our off season!
TIER 5: PRACTICE PADDLES:  The practice paddles we use during the off season at the swimming pool require significant maintenance from water damage, normal wear and tear, and splinters to name a few. Any additional funds we receive from our supporters will go towards varnishing, maintaining and possibly replacing some of these paddles! 

We know what you're wondering....

What happens if we don't reach our goals?
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that! But we know it is a big goal. Since McMaster Dragon Boat is a year-round sport and our team is continually fundraising, so this is only the first of many fundraisers to reach these goals!

Yes, we do play American Football in Germany. :)

Our team is existing now since close to 25 years and we have managed to develop some good players throughout the years.
Several have found their way into top division teams in Germany and/or HS & Colleges in the USA or Mexico.
  
One player Kasim Edebali even managed to find his way into the NFL as an DE.
He played 3 years for the Saints (followed by Broncos, Lions & Bears) and is currently playing for the Bengals.
The struggle of playing/coaching/supporting an American Football Team in Germany is of course that this sport is not as popular as Soccer/Football or other more common sports in Germany. Therefore finding supporters or sponsors is nearly impossible here.
Our coaching stuff is not getting paid.
We do this just for the love of the sport and our commitment towards the kids. 
So we do invest our free time usually around 2-3 times a week after our normal jobs.

Several of our young players are coming from rather poor families or have fled/migrated with their families from African countries towards Germany. 
Those do seek for new friends, something positive in their life and a team that they can call home.  
The majority of the money that we have available as a club is used for assisting those players to get a helmet, shoulderpads or shoes.

The rest is needed for gameday organisation (referee payment, field rent) or paying the transport for away games or a new set of jerseys.

So almost nothing is left for proper training equipment. 
(No sled, no chute, old blocking shields, old balls, etc...) 

So what would we like to purchase with that money that you can help us to raise....

- Footballs: We are pretty good to improvise around the lack of proper training equipment but we are for example always short of footballs.  As we do practice outdoor in the rainy and muddy spring time in Germany are the balls not lasting very long.
So getting a new set of footballs would be great!
- Blocking shields & Tackling dummies: We do have some basic shield but they are very limited and heavily used up.

-  There is 1 particular equipment we would like to have and that is a Jugs Machine.
There are several reasons why we do believe that our kids would benefit from this Jugs Machine.  One is: Nobody grows up with throwing footballs in the park with friends in Germany. So they start to learn it when joining us (at avg age 14-16y) but that means in return that often we coaches have to throw balls instead of focusing on other aspects of coaching. Plus it is hurting the development of our skill players when the ball hardly ever get's thrown correctly.
- Another needed equipment would be a blocking and/or tackling sled.
So please help us to reach our goal or even more so that we can order new balls + maybe a new or used Jugs Machine or Sled.

The raised money would be used mainly to cover the buying cost of the footballs or equipment.

We coaches have agreed to cover the majority of the shipping cost.

I am a university student at the University of Guelph who has played field hockey since grade 9. I have coached for two teams and played on many, including the Alberta provincial team. I love the sport and love passing the joy of the sport on to others.
I am running this campaign so that I can start a field hockey club at my university. There is currently nowhere at my university or town to play if you are not varsity or under 19. Field hockey has been a major part of my life for a long time and not having somewhere to play is hard. This team will allow me and many others to have somewhere to play, be ourselves, and de-stress from the intense university atmosphere. My goal is to raise enough money so that we can purchase 25 sticks, 40 balls, and if possible, one set of goalie equipment. This campaign is important to me as it will create a place for university students to go and play and just have fun. My hope is that this club will keep running after I have left the school, and that it will grow and expand our equipment stores and reach.
Please consider contributing to our group to bring this plan into fruition and share this page with anyone who might like to help us!
Feel free to ask us any questions you have about our new field hockey club!
Thank you,
Andrea and Jenny

My goal is to raise £700 as I have just been left without a job meaning that I have to pay for my flat and food essentials next month with no wages. I also want to become a full time athlete and donations from this rally would not only help me to pay rent for a month but also to help me get to competitions nationwide.
Why I'm Raising Funds
The funds will be used to help me afford my flat this month as well as help me travel too and from competitions.
How I Got Here
I have done high jump all my life but only now do I want to run with it as far as I can possibly go. This is why I need any donations big or small to help to fund my journey. Do I have a back up plan? No. But that makes me wake up every morning to work for the thing that I want most from live as I know that with nothing to fall back on, I'll either fly or die.

to be part of something inspiring and truly special? Do you believe in the power of sport? Are you a cricket tragic who tells anyone who will listen about the game?

Then we have something for you…

The story of the Granada Cricket Club sounds like fiction. If you have seen the movie Field of Dreams, you would know the basic story of how a dream leads to the creation of a field and the fulfilment of something special.

However, this club is real, a community of players is being formed, games have been played (lost mostly!) and some quite incredible progress on developing the oval has been made. Whether there is a happy ending or not, could depend on you… but more on that later.

Through the great game of cricket, the vision was (and remains) to create a positive, diverse and inclusive sporting community and arena for self-expression for all people regardless of their background, gender or orientation.

THE STORY UNTIL NOW
In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, cricket was introduced to Granada, Spain, when the Granada Cricket Club (GCC) was founded by Richard Abbott and Andrew Applin. Right from our first game in 2021, the red and blacks have proudly represented the vision each time we have competed in the Southern Cricket League, in the southeast of Spain. Since that time, the GCC home has been established on ‘Las Vegas’ of Granada, slowly converting a rubbish dump into a flat and cleared oval of earth at the foot of the Sierra Nevada.



THE NEED
Whilst significant progress has been made in purchasing the land and some back-breaking effort on clearing the rubbish, entrepreneurially acquiring and distributing the soil (we negotiated to get it for free from a local company clearing land for factories) and levelling and marking the oval, the finances are drained and there are still some unavoidable costs to finish the dream. It is presently an oval of soil, needing grass to be sowed, grown and managed.



OUR AIM
Our aim is to play our first game on the Granada Oval (affectionately titled the ‘GOval’) in April 2022.

To do so, we are seeking to raise € 8,979 to fund ‘the basics’ including grass seed, irrigation reel and sprinkler, cylinder mower and a water tank. That amount just allows the club to get off the ground (… well actually, on the ground!) and playing on its own oval.

If we to raise €14,327 we can create a true home including getting a heavy roller, creating fencing, and buying boundary ropes and a basic marquee clubhouse.

Here's what the dream could look like...

sport, and ultimately the establishment of MMA as an Olympic sport.  Since 2014, the GEMMAF has been a registered MMA association in Germany with partners such as their umbrella organisation the International Mixed Martial Arts Federation (IMMAF) and the UFC. Mixed martial arts is often referred to as the world’s fastest growing sport. The GEMMAF is focused on developing MMA as a sport, from the recreational level to the elite level, driving the development of common sets of rules, safety regulations (for example, blood tests at each event, application of the Unified Rules of MMA), structure, mutual exchanges and so forth.

Our vision is the recognition of mixed martial arts as a sport and the establishment of mixed martial arts as an Olympic sport.
Our Goals:
1. Create and enforce uniform regulations
2. Sustainable development of the athletes and the sports
3. Improve the image of the sport
4. Membership of the German Olympic Sports Confederation (DOSB)
During the year 2019, GEMMAF held 4 elimination tournaments across Germany to filter out the best amateurs in Amateur MMA and No Gi Grappling. The winners of these elimination tournaments will compete for the title of German Champion at the Stadthalle Falkensee, near Berlin on October 5th. The entire event will be live streamed on Facebook and Youtube, so that as many people as possible have access to the fights. We want to guarantee the amateurs a professional organization to rely on, as well as give them maximum attention that they deserve.
In oder to make this event happen, we have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! To help us reach our goals in further developing and promoting the sport MMA within Germany, as well as in representing Germany on the world stage, fight for medals on the international circuit, and have the means to do so.

My name is Tumisang and I am from Gaborone, Botswana. I am truly passionate about Archery, which I exercise as often as I can. My goal is to become the best athlete in ARCHERY , and I need your help to turn the impossible into a reality. 
I live in a Country called Botswana , located in the south of Africa right above South Africa . In my country archery is unknown or should i say unrecognized and rare ,which leads to poor development due to no proper facilities to practice and perfect the art . equipment is rare so it leads to it being over priced from neighboring countries . it came to a point were i had to make my own arrows out out feathers and dowel rods. By luck i have came into contact with a marks man hunter only that he uses a compound bow , but he lectures me through the fundamentals of Archery .. and i get better and better every training session . i met others people that do archery and they have came together and want to start an association for archery . SO I am moved to be the best and enter competitions to prove my growth in this sport. Please help me to leave a big foot print of this art in my country

Dear Rugby fans all over the world,
 These Ladies from the city of Izmir in Turkey are a horde of lionesses, a kind of Wonder Women who are living on the Aegean sea, like the legends did before them.
 They have been working hard to make it and have been champion of Turkey for the past five straight years. Half of them are playing in National Rugby Team of Turkey!
 This year they want to challenge European clubs and participate in Sevenice tournament, June 22 and 23, 2018 in Venice, Italy.
 To make this dream come true they need fans and 23,000TL (4,500 €). Fans because it is the first time a Turkish Sevens club will participate in an international tournament, and this is a lot of pressure so they need your support. We need money for the journey and hotel as we have no sponsor (yet) and pay everything by ourselves.
 Your support would be of great help. All little support can help: if 1000 (rugby) supporters donate 4,5 euro then these ladies and their coach Pierre Saliba can make their dream come true!

Yours sincerely,
Mugla - Izmir Anka Kusu also know as 'The Phoenix'

Başarıya ulaşmak için çok çalıştılar ve son beş yıldır ardarda Türkiye şampiyonu oldular. Takımın yarısı Türkiye Milli Rugby Takımı'nda oynuyor!
Bu yıl Avrupa kulüplerine meydan okumak ve İtalya'nın Venedik kentinde 22 ve 23 Haziran 2018'de düzenlenen Sevenice turnuvasına katılmak istiyorlar.
Hayallerini gerçekleştirebilmek için taraftarlara ve 23.000 TL'ye (4,500 €) ihtiyaçları var. Taraftarların desteği onlara, ilk kez uluslararası bir turnuvaya katılacak bir Türk Sevens kulübü olabilmeleri için, güç verecek. Maddi desteğe de ihtiyacımız var; yolculuk ve konaklama için (henüz) sponsorumuz yok ve her masrafı kendimizin karşılaması gerekiyor.
Sizin desteğiniz bize çok yardımcı olacaktır. Her küçük destek bizim için büyük bir katkı demektir: eğer 1000 (Rugby) destekçiden her biri 4,5 € bağışlarsa, bayanlar takımımız ve antrenörleri Pierre Saliba hayallerini gerçekleştirebilecek!
  Saygılarımla,
  Muğla - İzmir Anka Kuşu (The Phoenix).",,,,,,

Throughout my life I have played many sports, but when I was 10 I was introduced to a sport unlike any other, judo. When I started, I had my ups and downs as most kids do, changing your mind, not having and distinct goals and eventually left the sport.

For two years I wandered from sport to sport not finding anything like judo, nothing as fun or gratifying. I finally wandered back into the sport in 2010 and have done nothing but train. The first year back was rough but I knew that in time training would pay off.

Since coming back I have had great results. I have reached the podium at nearly every competition I have fought in for the past few years. Last year (July 2013) I fought in my first judo nationals and won a bronze medal. This year, I would like to go and improve on my previous performance by bringing home gold. Due to 15+ hours a week of training, I don't have much time to work. Financial support will make getting to nationals much easier.

Funding:
Contributions will be used to support the following:
Transport to Nationals, food and lodging while away
Registration and other costs
Donations will allow me to continue my results. My major tournament results are as follows:
Quebec Open 2012, 3rd
Ontario Open 2013, 3rd

I am Alex Colpitts.
I am a typical 18 year old living in Fredericton, NB. Just starting university and trying to figure out what I am going to do with my life. My life revolves around many things, school, music but most of all, judo.

Judo has always been my greatest passion. Judo isn't just a part of my life, it is my life. When I am not sitting in class I am training. Strength and conditioning, running, fighting, technique. I do everything that is humanly possible to make my judo better.

This past April I ran into a few problems. I felt amazing, my fighting was improving with great rapidity and another national medal seemed well within my grasp. At the last tournament before nationals I had planned on fighting three categories. Nobody registered for my category in U21 so winning seniors was my goal. I lost my first round fight but fought my way back to the bronze medal final. It was an opponent I had fought before and lost to by yuko nearly a year ago.

I felt great going into that fight but in a split second my entire training for nationals went down the drain. It was a knock down, beat up grind of a match with me coming out on top, leaving my opponent frustrated and desperate. As the time ticked by I turned in for a strong attack to finish the fight and all of a sudden BOOM! My opponent had launched me onto my shoulder via an illegal leg sweep, shattering my collar bone. All hopes for nationals, another medal and more funding were gone.

I was in a sling for nearly two months. Physiotherapy was started as soon as I could move my shoulder without unreasonable pain. Four months later I was finally able to return to training as normal. The time off the mats was rough. The physical recovery was the easiest part. Mentally recovering was the most brutal experience of all. I couldn't turn in or practice technique without fear of injury.

Judo in the coming years shall be difficult for me. Despite my body being fully healed and back to normal, university has left me lacking financially. My goal this year is to make the national team and without attending Quebec and Ontario Open, it shall be impossible. Your financial support shall allow me to attend these event and to meet my goals. These events shall also serve as stepping stones for the upcoming Canada Games.

Donations:
The funding I receive shall go to the following things:
-Food and Travel to tournaments
-Registration at tournaments
-Training

The Impact it will have is astounding.
Being able to attend these event shall help me to develop my judo and take me a step closer to realizing my dream of going to the Olympics and being an international fighter.
If you can't donate, please share my campaign on social media. All help is appreciated!

Thanks,
Alex Colpitts

Our long term goals are to develop lacrosse players that can receive scholarships, play at elite level and pass on the love of lacrosse to younger players.
We have been operating this group out of our pockets and are now at a point where we need some additional funding to continue moving forward. 
We have world class coaches in place - now need some funding

Campaign goals:
We are running this campaign to help expand the Lacrosse Academy and to send 4 of our players to National level tournaments
Lacrosse is a love of many young players here and we want them to see our area can produce athletes of this caliber.
These young men are training 6 to 7 days a week on top of attending school to get to these competitions. On the weekends their parents are driving them 100's of kms to train with other coaches and players to get that edge,
Use of funds:
The funds will be used to send these 4 players to the national level competitions.
They have to pay for transportation from New Brunswick to Ontario, pay for lodging while there for over a week, pay for meals, insurance and gear to play.

I have been doing judo since I was ten and looking back at how far this journey has taken me is rather profound. Being a young child and learning judo for the first time, fighting my first tournament, they seem to have occurred a lifetime ago.
Nearly a decade later, my love for the sport has yet to change despite these past few years being by far the most challenging. In 2013 I won a bronze medal at nationals after having a fantastic season. The next year began equally promising and continued in a most dominant fashion. At the Eastern Canadian Championships in 2014, the train that was my season was brutally derailed. In the bronze medal match in seniors, an illegal technique was used to counter my Uchi Mata. The resulting impact from the throw cracked my clavicle.
This forced me to the side lines for several months, causing me to miss fighting nationals. After several months of recovery, I was finally back on the mats. Training had finally returned to normal. My first large tournament in the fall, Quebec Open yielded another injury. My collarbone had failed to properly mend and resulted in another injury to it.

At the time, I was training for the Canada Games and had just enough time to recover and fight them to yield a dismal result. Upon my return from the games, I had surgery on my collarbone to resolve the issues.
This fall had been my first year at 100% since mid 2014. It had been a rough 13 months but the time had finally come. At my first major tournament back I earned a 4th place in U21 and 3rd in Open Weight at Quebec Open. The following weekend, at Ontario Open, I earned a 3rd place in Seniors, landing myself a spot on the national team and a national G standard. My performances managed to have me ranked 7th in Canada, qualifying me for the Elite 8 where I earned a 5th place.
After the Elite 8 I found that I was invited to a tournament in Bremen, Germany. It is a rather costly trip but it will help get me one step closer to a higher national standard as well as one step closer to qualifying for the Francophone Games in 2017.
Beyond the campaign for Bremen, I would also seek your support in getting me to Nationals this year in Calgary, Alberta where I may also continue my quest for the podium.

Cheers,

Our main goals this year are: to win multiple tournaments and qualify to play in the AAU National Tournament at the end of the season.
Our journey of being student athletes has taught us so much about ourselves, such as our strengths and weaknesses, and how hard we can push ourselves physically and mentally. We have been to quite a few tournaments all over the DMV area, where we learned so much more about the sport of basketball. To become world-class athletes, we have to push our limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, we want more and we know we can do more. We are ready to push our limits even further as we know that we can work our way onto a podium.
To be able to reach these goals this year, we have to pay $3,500. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund our fees.

To be exact, Western Ville is looking to help the talented low-income and underprivileged young adults in our area to play the beautiful game of soccer at a semi-professional level. Unfortunately, soccer is losing the interested of young players all around. which is very sad, With a small number of players being recruited to play professionally in the US, many top-class players are forced to give up on their dreams when asked to pay hundreds of dollars to participate for a “ look “ or a chance to be seen. 

Western Ville 1892 CF is actively seeking to upend this model and sponsor talent of all kind in the Frederick/Walkersville community, Soccer is for all. Not a select few, Western Ville 1892 CF is on a mission of becoming a successful team competing in UPSL Premier over the next couple of years.

The level of excitement is above this world, the players who have joined or plan to join can’t wait to begin. This is a dream come true for many.

We would love for you to be a part of our journey. Whether you are a player, Sponsor, fan, volunteer, individual donor, nonprofit organization, or local business, we would love the opportunity to work with anyone wanting to be involved, our motto is “ unite and believe “ unite the community and have the belief beyond our community supporting us and our players believing they can play at any level if given the chance.

Judo has always been a part of my life since I first moved to Fernie in grade one and I started at our local club. Having fun was really my only reason to do judo up until two years ago at the 2012 B.C. Winter games where I competed in my first large scale tournament, I got third place as one of the youngest competitors and it was then that I knew I had found my passion. That season followed to really help with my skill development leading to a gold at the Edmonton International and Bronze at the Canadian Judo Nationals. Ever since then I have trained to my fullest extent with the limited resources we have in my small town, and that is one of our biggest problems to face. Being a small community we do not have the opportunities or the facilities to train like the athletes from larger cities. But I do not let this get in the way of my passion! I would love to see my judo career excel to a point where I can travel the world meet new people and see new things while competing and training for a sport I love. My parents love me and want to support me with my passion of judo but due to our financial state we find it hard to come up with the money to continue with my dreams. Your contribution would help me and my family get me to where I want to be with my career. If I reach my goal of $1500 the money will go towards mainly travel cost for unfortunately it is very expensive to get across the country but also for new gi’s, braces and any other sports/medical equipment I will need during my journey to the podium. The Canadian championships, much like the B.C. games, is a building block for a young Athletes career like mine and I do not only want to attend the event but I want to take home the podium. Thank you for your time and your contribution, if you are not able to donate that is absolutely fine maybe you're in a situation much like mine and cant afford it if so even spreading the word and sharing my page can help a ton.

Hi! My name is Carissa Holinaty and I am a high school teacher and advocate of pony breeds. I developed a passion and appreciation for ponies because of my grandmother, Gen Kurtenbach, who raised Welsh Ponies and was a founding breeder of the rare Canadian Rustic Pony. She had a riding school and always shared as much knowledge as she could with people who wanted to learn about owning, riding, driving and showing ponies.
My Grandmother is my inspiration and I feel obligated to pass on my knowledge I was fortunate enough to gain from her. I always welcome children to the farm and teach them about ponies and allow them time to groom, ride and drive the ponies. Grace Wiszniak is one of the children who comes to the farm on a regular basis to work with the ponies. She absolutely loves it and has learned how to groom the ponies, lunge them, ride western and english, drive the ponies and also competes with them at local shows.
Last summer, I purchased a critically endangered Newfoundland Pony and am now dedicated to helping preserve this special pony breed. In 3 years I will choose a stallion to breed Gewels to in order to help increase the numbers within the breed. However, before that time comes, it is our goal to promote this breed by educating others about Newfoundland Ponies. It is also very important to train and show Gewels in order to develop her performance record, which will help expose Gewels to the public and show how versatile this breed is.
Our campaign goals:
We recently heard about the EQUUS SURVIVAL TRUST 2016 Festivale of Endangered Equines & SANA Rare Breed Show that is happening June 14 - 16 in Lexington, Virginia. It is the only Rare Breed Show in North America and the last one (and only one to date) was in 2008!
This show will be showcasing rare equine breeds and judged under high level judges from the UK. It is uncertain how many Newfoundland Ponies will be shown at this show, as majority of the ponies reside in Canada. There are approximately only 440 Newfoundland Ponies in the world and it is important to showcase this breed at this special show.
This campaign will help make this goal a reality, especially since it is difficult to travel that far to the United States with our dollar being as low as it is. We are boarding our pony at a facility that is located closer to Grace and I so we can train Gewels on a daily basis in preparation for the show.
We're raising funds for:
In order to be able to attend the Rare Breed show in June, we are looking to raise funds for:

- Vet: $261.00
- Farrier: $135.00
- Training Clinics: $350.00
- Transportation: $845.00
- Accommodation: $560.00
- Meals: $ 662.00
- Entry Fees: $155.00
- Stabling: $130.00
These costs do not include the proper attire and required equipment that will be needed for the various classes.
Why we need your support:
- This will be a once in a lifetime experience for Grace, who has been working very hard to learn as much as she can about ponies and being the best equestrian she can.
- We are working very hard to train Gewels and it is important to develop her performance record before she becomes a valuable broodmare as a critically endangered species.
- This show has only taken place once before and may not occur in the near future.
- The show is a very long distance from us and since the dollar is low, it makes it very costly to attend.

We are very grateful and appreciative of any form of contribution you can make to help us carry out this journey.

Personally, I've had the pleasure of mostly coaching girls and the more I coached the more I wanted to make a difference in their lives. I loved the relationship and community that I built as as a mentor. Going through the sport experience myself in high school, I had every reason to quit and not continue. It was hard. When I had the opportunity to research the topic of girls participation in sport with The King's University, I figured this would be a perfect way to reach out to our future community of girls in Alberta to become the next generation of sports and active-for-life leaders within our community. This small research project has grown exponentially and I decided to use this information to make a difference. This was why Girls In Sports AB was formed.
I think the key to being an effective change-maker is the motivation to do everything you possibly can to set girls up to be successful in all aspects of their life. The next generation will always be the key to the future success of our nation. It’s our responsibility to set them up with the proper skills to navigate this changing world. My vision is to help grow girls' confidence to be change makers and barrier breakers of the future through physical activity and sport. I believe this will help them become well rounded so they can participate in any type of physical activity and bring life long success in whatever future career they decide to pursue. I want to be able to give girls the knowledge and confidence that they need to carry on into adulthood in order to engage in a healthy and active lifestyle.
 Now I’m excited to move forward with GISAB. The community support has been overwhelming and I’m excited to see where this goes next!",28.0,2.0,12.0,66.0,4.0,40.0

In the last few years i have become a high performance athlete. During those few years I've been trying as hard as i can to train hard and develop my judo into something amazing.  Throughout these trainings i have had break downs, success and many different emotions of overwhelmingness  passion and of course love for the sport of judo. 
My success has been at mostly local tournaments 
except i have gotten gold at west Edmonton mall three times
bronze at ontario open in seniors
bronze at Quebec Open

My fears are that one day i might get seriously injured that i won't be able to come back from.

My campaign is here to help me fund my trips that i won't be able to cover. I hope to push forward in judo, hopefully in the next year manage to go to some international tournaments and winning at more national tournaments such as Quebec open and Pacific international. this is important to me because as the years go on i find that i am able to push myself more and more and by doing this i hope to see how far i can push myself into perfecting my judo.
As contributors you'll help me accomplish getting to these tournaments and helping me find out how much the last years have paid off by fighting new opponents and finding my weakness's and strengths. 
its critical for me because this way i won't  have to spend many nights off judo to work.
The money I receive from my donators will be used for transportation and accommodations to the tournaments.",9.0,0.0,3.0,15.0,2.0,9.0

Our team represents Twin City Tennis Camps. We have trained over the summer for four hours each morning on weekdays. Now we train over the weekends are practice almost everyday. After our exciting win at Sectionals, we look forward to success at Nationals. 

Going to Nationals is a dream come true for all of us as players of the sport. We want to take our futures in tennis as far as they can go, that being college tennis or going pro. We met many new players at sectionals from all over the state and hope to encounter an even higher diversity at nationals. 

As fun as it is, our trip to South Carolina is not very affordable. For some of us, our family has to pay double because we are siblings. An extra hand can help us all have an amazing experience, and play well without worrying about the cost. 

How we will use this sponsorship:
It will cost around $800 for each player to attend, and one of our players is flying in from Egypt! Although we are asking for $2000, any amount would help us greatly because of our total cost of $6,400 
The plane ride on October 23rd will cost us $490 each and with hotel reservations, food, and taxi rentals, the grand total for all players is $6,400; Not to mention we have four parents attending with us who's costs are not included in the price above. 
We have all of our equipment necessary to play the game. If we are able to raise enough money, we plan to get uniforms for the team to show our unity. 
The Impact it will have 
This trip will give our team time to bond while playing skilled players from around the nation. This can teach us more about how children our age play in the rest of the nation. 
Our team got first place at Area competitions in Coon Rapids. From there we went on to get first place at Northern Sectionals, which now allows us to participate in Nationals. All of our players play on Varsity for our school teams, and most of us have won several local tournaments. 
We play at an organization called Twin City Tennis Camps housed in Golden Valley, MN. It has over 2000 campers every year from all over the world. If you are looking to expand your business, we are more than welcome to advertise, if you can help our team in return.

the perseverance to work every single day towards a goal that some would conceive as unachievable  it is also rare to find a business and coach who can support that dedication so that the athletes can be the best that they can be  crank wrestling  eckville ab  has found a home over the last five years in your community  every year enrolment is increasing and the youth of the community are learning skills that will last a life time  some of these youth will continue on in the sport and we may be lucky to see them as olympians in the future  as all minor sports teams are aware it takes a lot to back these athletes to support them so they can have the best opportunities  the gym has received major recognition as of late  an invitation to the world catch wrestling championship in humbolt iowa july 3  there will be representatives at these world championships from england  mexico  japan  australia  singapore and crank wrestling will be the soul representative from canada  when first approached last year about this championship tournament owner  coach and wrestler adam laporte had no one who could qualify at the gym other then himself to compete  this past season an amazing athlete drew persson  at the age of fifteen started her training and has far surpassed any expectation of an athlete in her first year  by the end of the freestyle wrestling season drew walked away with several medals  she went on to win gold for the rural high school championship and pinned her way to the 4a high school team title  this is phenomenal  adam has spent his entire life in some form of organized fighting sport  after receiving one on one training by coach roy wood @ the snake pit in england and receiving his certification to teach catch wrestling what better way to support the name of the gym by placing in iowa at the world catch wrestling championships   we can all offer up praise at what an amazing coach adam has been to the children that he teaches  he is a dedicated and outstanding role model  it will not go without notice that he promotes the children's wrestling and often sits in the background  the best way to teach children is leading by example  please help me help them by raising the funds to cover the costs of travel and accommodation while on the road to success  adam has been known to say that anything worth having takes work  that if you are willing to put in the time then you will succeed on the mat  i believe these two wrestlers are the example of working on the mats (if you have ever wrestled either of them you know what i am saying)  we have been raising money thus far by selling merchandise such as bumper stickers  and t shirts  yet i cannot stress the importance of a community's support where young athletes are concerned  it would be amazing if in her first year drew could come home with a world championship title  that alone speaks volumes on why our support for adam and drew means so much ,,counting days world championship adam

down the days until the World Championship! Adam and Drew are on the mats and in the Gym daily training to land Canada on the podium at the World Catch Wrestling Championship tournament in Humbolt Iowa on July 3rd.
It is a rare opportunity in a rural community that we come across athletes who have poise and dedication in an Individual sport such as wrestling. The perseverance to work every single day towards a goal that some would conceive as unachievable. It is also rare to find a business and coach who can support that dedication so that the athletes can be the best that they can be. Crank Wrestling, Eckville AB. has found a home over the last five years in your community. Every year enrolment is increasing and the youth of the community are learning skills that will last a life time. Some of these youth will continue on in the sport and we may be lucky to see them as olympians in the future. As all minor sports teams are aware it takes a lot to back these athletes to support them so they can have the best opportunities. The gym has received major recognition as of late, an invitation to the World Catch Wrestling Championship in Humbolt Iowa July 3. There will be representatives at these World Championships from England, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Singapore and Crank Wrestling will be the soul Representative from Canada. When first approached last year about this championship tournament Owner, Coach and Wrestler Adam Laporte had no one who could qualify at the gym other then himself to compete. This past season an amazing athlete Drew Persson, at the age of fifteen started her training and has far surpassed any expectation of an athlete in her first year. By the end of the freestyle wrestling season Drew walked away with several medals. She went on to win Gold for the Rural high school championship and pinned her way to the 4A high school team title, this is phenomenal. Adam has spent his entire life in some form of organized fighting sport. After receiving one on one training by Coach Roy Wood @ the Snake Pit in England and receiving his certification to teach Catch Wrestling what better way to support the name of the gym by placing in Iowa at the World Catch Wrestling Championships.  We can all offer up praise at what an amazing Coach Adam has been to the Children that he teaches. He is a dedicated and outstanding role model. It will not go without notice that he promotes the Children's wrestling and often sits in the background. The best way to teach Children is leading by example. Please help Me help them by raising the funds to cover the costs of travel and accommodation while on the road to success. Adam has been known to say that anything worth having takes work. That if you are willing to put in the time then you will succeed on the mat. I believe these two wrestlers are the example of working on the mats (if you have ever wrestled either of them you know what I am saying). We have been raising money thus far by selling merchandise such as bumper stickers, and t-shirts. Yet I cannot stress the importance of a community's support where young athletes are concerned. It would be amazing if in her first year Drew could come home with a World Championship title. That alone speaks volumes on why our support for Adam and Drew means so much!",11.0,1.0,7.0,20.0,4.0,18.0

We aren't asking for living costs - we get by on what we make for a living, and we will probably be able to afford the armour we need - but flights from South Africa are expensive. It will cost us ZAR1025 each for a visa to get into Luxembourg, and around ZAR12000 each for a flight from Durban to Luxembourg. This amounts to just under 5000 Euros for six people (four team members, one armourer and one support staff).
By adding your support, you will be getting behind a HUGE breakthrough in the sport of medieval combat in South Africa, particularly for women, whose achievements are often sidelined. Help us make this achievement; help us to get the momentum and drive this initiative! These four brave, determined women need SOMEONE's backing. Yours is welcome.

My main goals this year is to win the UAE SUPERSTOCK CHAMPIONSHIP rookie trophy at the end of the season.
My journey of being an amateur motorcycle racer has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. To become competitive as a rookie I had to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way onto the podium.
To be able to reach these goals I have to pay 8000$ for the upcoming season. As a student, I am not able to work full time, I have done many part time job in order to pay the fees. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my fees. By contributing you will help me reach my goals but you will also take part in our journey of becoming a superstock rookie champion.

Junior Cadet Club has been running a soccer club since May 2015.  Our club kids practiced and trained all summer long.  Junior Cadet Club held an open call competition.  Junior Cadet Club is affordable to those of low income or not able to travel far distances to attend other less affordable clubs in the city.  Our kids are eager to play other teams and build their leadership skills and good sportsmanship abilities. 

This fundraiser will help us complete this long-term goal of being part of the TSA and the ability to compete with other teams.  The fees are due shortly so this fundraiser is paramount to keeping our kids and club engaged.  Being part of the League has many benefits such as coach training and more.
Campaign goal
We are running this campaign in order to raise enough funds to cover fees associated with the League.
It is important to reach this minimal goal in order to keep our club playing and moving forward.  The fee paid to be part of our club only covers the costs for equipment such as shin guards for those who can't afford them, Jerseys, balls, etc.  All else is run by volunteers.
Raising funds for the League fees will allow our club to compete against other teams across the Toronto's GTA for the year.
JCC trains every Friday evening out of a school gym in downtown Toronto.  Our trainer/coach is Miguel, who is an avid soccer fan/player and is almost fully qualified.  As a fairly new group we face challenges such as advertising and finding appropriate volunteers but our present volunteers spend much time putting up posters, handing out flyers and using social media.  We are confident our program will succeed to a higher level in time but are sure that being part of the League will be paramount to getting there faster as it will cover some expenses we have had to cover and offer up other avenues for training, opportunities and finding qualified coaches.
  Use of funds:
The money raised will go directly to League Fees due in the next couple of weeks.
Our costs are minimal at this time as we donate our time and our permit is under a grant.  Travel costs are covered by the parents at this time.
Contributor importance:
Contributors will be helping many youth see their dreams come true.
You can also help by sharing and supporting this campaign.
Any donation of $25 and up will receive a thank you and a Junior Cadet Club pen.
All donations will receive a newsletter (opt out available) containing news of our club, how they are doing and more!
Junior Cadet Club thanks you for your time and support.  Every little bit helps get our youth to where they have worked and trained to get to.

The school is not a basketball school by culture..the school is populated by 90% of students where English is a second language. We are improving every year, but a part of the buy in from the student population is being accepted and feeling like they belong. We also believe that to succeed and compete with the other schools that have it better than we do from a financial aspect, we have to have adequate equipment, and that starts with the shoes they put on their feet. Every year we struggle to raise the money necessary to purchase all of the clothing and equipment needed to make the boys feel comfortable and adequate. The process is long, it takes patience, perseverance, and a very dedicated athlete and organization to make it happen. Sequoyah Middle School Boys Basketball has 25 athletes and coaches and support staff working together to get ready for the season. We have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! To help us reach our goals in representing our School and having the means to do so.
The average cost of a season for a player to participate is $250. Athletes are supposed to buy in with a $150 participation fee to help go towards shoes, travel clothes, bags, and game day meals. We always end up needing to fund raise to come up with enough money to get by, and if we could get enough money donated to take care of the shoe cost (the most expensive necessary item), we could easily raise enough to get everything we need for the boys to give it their best.
By contributing, you are supporting Sequoyah Middle School Boys Basketball as an organization and its athletes. You are also becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, that is helping young athletes that wouldn't be able to participate otherwise. Being a part of the Sequoyah Middle School Boys Basketball is a big step forward in an athlete's development and growth, and we believe we can really make a difference in these students lives with a sense of belonging!

Head Boys Basketball Coach of Team Finish 16U.
This spring and summer our team will compete on four different competitive circuits: Adidas Gauntlet, Big-Shots, USA Alliance and Hoop Group. Our number one goal is to put these young men in a position to obtain a college basketball scholarship.
My inspiration to be in this position as a leader of young men began 24 years ago in Hyattsville Maryland, I was playing ball  for  my Green Meadows basketball team which included many of my childhood friends but the most inspiring person was our coach. He made us work harder than we've ever worked and made us feel important and capable of doing anything we set our minds to do. That year our minds was set on winning a championship and we'd conquered!  From that day I wanted to be that leader that changed lives and mindsets in a positive way. After graduating high school I begin to exercise my dreams coaching basketball and 18 years later I'm gifted with this special group of young men which could be the first I prepared to play college basketball and help obtain scholarships. 
To be able to reach these goals this summer I have to pay 50,000. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help our team fund travel, room, board, uniforms, equipment, gym space, and food fees. By contributing you will help to eliminate the financial burden that stands in our way of achieving the ultimate goal.",9.0,1.0,2.0,13.0,1.0,14.0

Léif Supporter, Memberen an Spiller vun de Kordall Steelers,
säit 2010 an der Fusioun zwëschen der Red Boys vun Déifferdeng an Southside Péiteng hunn mär et fäerdeg bruecht de Veräin all Joer en Stéck no vir ze bréngen. Sief dat an der Jugend, beim Trainerstaff oder bei den Seniors-Equipen. An der Saison 2018/19 hun d’Kordall Steelers déi éischt kéier an der Veräinsgeschicht an der Total League gespillt. Dësen Opstig wär ouni d’Hëllef vun all de Memberen, benevollen an Spiller awer net méiglech gewiescht. Eisen Veräin lieft nämlech virun allem vun den Einnamen ronderëm de Basketballterrain (Festivitéiten, Events an Buvetten).
Dëst Joer wollten mär mat e puer speziellen Events eisen 10. Gebuertsdag uerdentlech feieren. Duerch d’Corona-Krise falen déi Momenter an och déi domat verbonnen Recetten an d’Waasser. Dëss Recetten waren an eisem Budget fir d’Saison 2020/21 ageplangt an wärten elo feelen.
Fir dass mär trotzdeem eis nächst Saison sou gutt wéi méiglech plangen kënnen, hunn mer d’Aktioun “Support Kordall. Together we are Steel” an d’Liewen geruff. Iwwert dësen Wee kann där eis elo schonn fir déi nächst Saison ënnerstëtzen.
Duerch déi verschidden packagen hëlleft där net nëmmen eis, mais där hutt selwer och nächst Saison e puer Virdeeler.
Hëlleft eis an dësen schwieregen Zäiten an garantéiert domat eng méi suergenfräi Zukunft fir eis erwuessen Spiller an eis vill Kanner, déi op eng optimal Betreiung ugewisen sin.
Mär soen iech Merci fir är Ënnerstëtzung.

Trainingen goufen bis op Weideres gestoppt . Den Boxclub wäert fir des Saison séng Dieren leider net méi opman. 
Dest bréngt mat sech, dass d´Kotisatiounen vum Trimester net erankommen an den Club doduercher finanziell um Nullpunkt steet, d´Existenz steet um Spill an och eis geplangten Gala déi am November 2020 soll stattfannen steet op der Kipp.

We are scheduled to play about 30 varsity games in June against competition from all over the Upper Midwest in tournaments, leagues and college team camps. This is a core piece of our year-round development plan for Lincoln Basketball but the cost is high for our kids to compete. To put a JV and Varsity team in every event during the offseason, it’ll cost us $5400. Obviously, this is a huge cost for us since we don’t charge kids or parents for our year-round development program.

Please consider donating to the Rails Basketball Club to help us pay for our offseason development costs this year. We have a target of $6000 to cover the entry fees but if we can raise more than that, we are able to send our most promising and committed young players to Elite Camps in the area. In the past, we’ve paid for camps for players at Iowa State, Point Guard College, Breakthrough Basketball, Handle University, Court Time and Snow Valley. We firmly believe that our recent rise on the floor is contributed heavily to the experience gained by our student-athletes at these camps and clinics.
 With your donation to the Rails Basketball club, this high level of development will cost our Southside families nothing. We are already hosting a series of youth clinics and competitions because of the funding of our community. With your help, we can take the next step and make the Rails Basketball Club a year-round development program for all levels.
All donations will go to the BLH-Boys Basketball Booster Account to allow us to pay for camps, clinics, tournaments and leagues.",5.0,0.0,7.0,17.0,3.0,12.0

The aim of this tour is to culturally build bridges through rugby and at the same time, expose Colorado youth rugby players to an international level of rugby at a young age. The goal is to send a well balanced team of developing players who can represent us both as talented ambassadors of this great country, both on and off the pitch. We will be sending a team that will consist of both boys and girls.""
The selection process was based on the following criteria and I am honored that I was identified for these components of my game:

1. Understanding of the game - game management
2. Skills
3. Performance and work rate
4. Behavior on the pitch
5. Development potential

To be able to participate in this tour, I need to raise $2,500.00.  I will be doing various neighborhood tasks over the next few months to raise money but I would really appreciate your support too - every cent will help me. By contributing you will not only help me reach my goals but you will also take part in my journey of experiencing the most amazing opportunity while playing the game I love so much. 
My daddy has given me some of his personl Springbok items that he has saved over the years, to help me raise funds. You can see a list of them that you can get as a reward for donating.  But please also feel free to donate if you don't want any of the items, but would like to just assist me with my quest to achieve my financial goal to be able to travel to the St Devote Tournament.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. You can be assured that no matter what, I will be giving my all when I step on that pitch in Monaco.

- Coach Murphy Criss also known as ""Coach Trey"" is a disabled navy veteran who has dedicated his life to protecting our country. He has now chosen to dedicate his time and effort to support our youth by coaching and guiding them in the sport of football. He is a dedicated father of three who has taken under his wing 30 youth boys whom he wants to provide with the tools to be great athletes. 
-Coach Trey and his coaching staff have a mission to not only make these boys better ahtletes but also help grow them into young men. When Coach Trey was coming up as a youth, his neighborhood catered to the youth and their betterment and he wants to bring that back to the community by offering football to all boys who want to play no matter their income status.
- Coach Trey believes that our kids are the future and he is here to help guide these kids to better places and opportunities. The feeling of watching a child look up to you for guidance and understanding is one of Coach Trey's greatest accomplishments and a blessing in his eyes.
My campaign goals:
The goal of this campaign is to raise money for new uniforms, helmets and tournament fees. The importance of this campaign far outweighs the smiles these boys give every time there out on the field and working hard to bring home the win.
Coach Trey practices with the boys 4 times a week and hosts football film watch parties at his house in order to get the boys ready for competition. The boys think of his home as a second home. Some challenges that the team faces is that we are just starting out and making sure that these boys have everything they need to be successful on and off the field is our main goal.
Why I need your support:
This newly formed football team needs your support, their coach needs your support!! Please donate and share this campaign and let everyone you know help a group of youth boys reach their potential as great ahtletes and up and coming young men. 
A good start always provides for a well fought for finish and these boys and their coach desire to finish strong!!!!",13.0,0.0,1.0,22.0,8.0,20.0

The SANDRO ACADEMY is working to get top athletes to promote international goodwill and understanding through Judo. The process is long, it takes patience, perseverance, and a very dedicated athlete and organization to make it happen.

To help us reach our goals in representing Jakarta, Indonesia on the international stage, fight for medals on the international circuit, and have the means to do so.

Athletes are responsible for covering expenses to attend all the necessary training camps, train year-round, travel and accommodation, competition entry fees, facility fees, and equipment, amongst other things.

Recently, due to clerical errors, her care and Mobile Therapist was taken away from her, and she suffered a severe setback that was filled with panic attacks  and other issues. Dance has been her one outlet that has soothed and calmed her. It has been her therapy. It has kept her going while her family fought her agency on the matter and battled to restore her care. 
In addition, Emma has now been offered the opportunity of a lifetime, a trip to New York City to perform on Broadway, perform in Times Square, and study in a Master Class with Hamilton's Jordan Fisher! Jordan is an idol of Emma's, and she practically hyperventilated when she learned of the opportunity.
The costs of dance, plus the trip to New York, leave Emma needing sponsorship. She is going through so much and is facing such a battle this year. We as a family want to make her dreams come true. We are humbling ourselves and asking for help this season. Please help us help Emma! Thank you all so much in advance. She has been though so much, and we just want to put a smile back on her face!",6.0,2.0,8.0,13.0,3.0,6.0

'Academia de Fútbol THUNDER' is a brand new soccer academy located in Costa Rica that was born just 2 weeks ago. Our purpose is use soccer as a tool to influence the youth to help them to become great people for society and top players in the field. Thats the formula we think will help them to reach success in their life. 
We want to become a platform to teach our core values to the players Respect, self-confidence, responsibility, perseverance, fellowship and excellence, also a platform to develop innovative soccer sessions, teaching English to the kids through the drills and bringing them support to keep them studying while they play soccer at the same time. Motivating them to reach scholarships to study and play in the US. Also we want to help girls specially, because is very uncommon for girls to have soccer training opportunities in Costa Rica and we want to bring them high level training. Our dream is to reach with our players the top division leagues.
To achieve all of these, we need budget to buy the academy uniforms for all the categories from 6years to 20 years old and rent the facilities for all the season that will start after the lockdown. Because most of our players are very talented but the are in poverty situation and is very hard for their families to spend money. 
We hope you want to support us and become part of our soccer family. We will be happy to share with you some of our Pura Vida energy in the field!!!",11.0,0.0,4.0,19.0,1.0,12.0

My name is Madison Olson and I have been sailing professionally for the last ten years on vessels ranging from 25 to 145 feet. I was born in Key West, Florida to a family of adventurers that fostered a love for the ocean and a need for exploration. I spent my childhood raised on a sailboat off the coast of the Florida Panhandle, and from the time I was small I worked with my father building boats. At the age of 21, I received my Merchant Mariner Credential and began to skipper yachts in the Caribbean and the USA. Since then, I have raced in a multitude of regattas around the USA, Europe, and the Caribbean.
The Mini Transat began in 1977 in England by the avid yachtsman, Bob Salmon. It was created with the purpose of providing an affordable offshore solo race for sailors and it has become a incubator for professional offshore sailing, like the Vendée Globe. The Mini is a solo and unassisted race, beginning in France and finishing in the Caribbean, and runs in odd numbered years. To qualify for this race, sailors need to achieve 1500 nautical miles combining multiple races with their own boat. Each sailor has to complete a 1000 nautical mile circuit, solo and non-stop, in order to demonstrate mental and physical fitness.
This process takes about two years of training in a wide range of solo and double handed regattas around Europe. I have chosen a prototype vessel that is fitted to project me to the podium. The funds received will be put forth to purchase the vessel, which assumes about 70 percent of the overall budget. The Prototype 930, is for sale for 80,000 euros and will be paid for in part by myself, donors and sponsors. I am the only American woman involved with this level of sailing and intend on running a well-rounded campaign. I am looking to partner with an NGO to raise awareness for global disaster recuperation so that there is more of a balance between sport and community outreach. 
The goals to be achieved, during this time frame, are increasing international popularity to the sport, highlighting the equality of women in sailing, ignite interest in the American public, and successfully running a campaign that unites corporate sponsors and a nonprofit institution.",3.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,7.0

You should donate anything you can for Kaede because it would be better to have a little push for his great experience. Just that small act of kindness will push us very far.

We are both so excited to be trained by Coach Andre Snyman, South African Springboks legend.

Here is a little about the St Devote International 7s Tournament:
""At the invitation of Her Serene Highness, Princess Charlene of Monaco, a group of twelve U12 Colorado rugby players will be travelling to Monaco, in May 2019, to participate in the St Devote International U12 7’s Rugby Tournament held at the Louis II Stadium in Monaco, and organized by the Monegasque Rugby Federation, in collaboration with the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation.
The aim of this tour is to culturally build bridges through rugby and at the same time, expose Colorado youth rugby players to an international level of rugby at a young age. The goal is to send a well balanced team of developing players who can represent us both as talented ambassadors of this great country, both on and off the pitch.""",8.0,0.0,5.0,17.0,1.0,13.0

Hello!  I'm Brendan Yakura, I'm soon to be 14 in april.  I'm an active, member of the Vernon Judo Club, and have been since 2007.  Recently I was promoted to my Second Kyu (blue belt) just before the B.C. Winter Games where I won gold.  I enjoy the outdoors, trying all sports and taking photos and videos of all things that interest me.  I care about my family and friends very much.

   Goals:   

In this 2013/2014 Judo season I've set many goals that i have accomplished and are yet to begin!  Early in the year I won gold in Abbotsford at the B.C. Championships, then got silver at the Pacific international in Richmond B.C.  Just before that I won silver at the Vancouver international losing to a U18 brown belt.  Then I went on to the B.C. Winter Games and won gold!  Beating two u18 brown belts, very tough fights.  A little while later I went on to the Edmonton International to fight for gold but lost in a very competitive fight, and got silver.  Now I have a competition in Prince George in a few days, with the B.C. open after that, I'm expecting to get gold in both.  All these tournaments along with multiple training camps and hundreds of practices, I'm now prepared to go on to win the 2014 Canadian Judo Championships.  Last year at Nationals I only won one fight and lost two very close ones, making me even more determined to get that shiny Gold medal around my neck.

   Why I want your help:

This trip to Quebec is looking to be very expensive, my parents have been spending lots of money on my Judo career which has been all worth it, but now I need a little help from you to help me get there.  The trip is going to be quite costly ($1200, just for me) and with food costs and other small things it will be even more.  Your fundraising will help cover, airfare costs, food and 2 new IJF approved Judo Gi's.  All donations will be greatly appreciated. ",7.0,5.0,11.0,16.0,8.0,9.0

Now entering its 6th season, AVCC started in 2008 with just 50 athletes. The Valley’s premier Cheer Club has since grown to over 130 athletes. In 5 short years we have won over 25 Championship Titles and 5 National Titles!

We provide quality instruction in a fun, welcoming, and SAFE environment. Cheerleading has offered something new to local youth (young girls in particular) who are not involved in other, more traditional, organized sports. We have had over 300 local youth (of which 95% have been female) from Hantsport to Middleton come through the program in the past 5 years. We strongly believe that this program has offered them structure, taught them respect for self and others, has brought them to practices and kept them out of trouble, in the way that other sports do, but that they would not have received because, as previously mentioned, they are not interested in traditional sports. Cheerleading offers the values of traditional sports, but targets youth who are interested in performance as well.

Cheerleading focuses on the team working together to achieve a common goal, that being the performance of a flawless routine that incorporates stunts, dance, tumbling, gymnastics, and therefore they need to be fit, strong, athletic, learn to work as a team, have confidence and respect. AVCC fosters the growth and development of these youth while teaching them lessons in commitment, dedication, teamwork, and responsibility that they will carry with them in life well beyond the realm of cheerleading.

 This year we are working hard to raise funds to improve our equipment to better the training for our athletes. Currently we rent out of local facilities and do not have a permanent location, this limits the equipment we are able to use, as it needs to be portable, and quick to set up and take down. At approximately $4000.00 for this equipment, we do not have the funds on hand to make this happen. At AVCC, we strongly believe in giving youth opportunities to better their skills, and as such we are holding a ticket auction to raise funds to offset the costs of this new equipment. Our athletes have enormous potential, they are talented, young, hardworking athletes that have the skills to reach higher levels and obtain personal goals, but they need the proper tools to help them get there. We have raised $1300.00 to dates towards our goal of $4000.00 and are reaching out to the public to assist us in being able to help these athletes reach their full potential. We have another fundraising campaign going on locally in which we hope to raise another $1000.00 and our reaching out through this medium to try and raise the remaining $1700.00",16.0,0.0,0.0,33.0,5.0,16.0

Mikhi just recently turned 16 and this is her second year playing on the Rugby Alberta team. This is her last year to be able to enjoy a learning experience for rugby until trying out for the ""big leagues"" being the U18 team (not to say that U16 isn't big, because it is). This is an important year for her because she really wants to embrace the knowledge of her coaches, Graeme Forsyth and Shannon Court, which you could ask any girl from their team and they would all tell you, they know a lot. As a team, they've practiced for the past two weekends in Calgary, a 3 hour practice on Friday and a 2.5 hour practice on Saturday. She thinks that they are really uniting as a team and bonding well. She thinks they will be quite successful this year at Nationals. They have a very strong group of girls.

Her total fund for Nationals is $1250.00. The expense includes her team gear, (a jersey, a couple shirts, socks, and shorts), travel, sleeping accommodations, and food. Rugby Alberta is so important to her because rugby is her favourite sport and she would love to play this game right until she graduates from University. That is looking quite far into the future, but that is her ultimate goal. Gaining experience by playing rugby outside of the school season will help by giving her a better chance for making a University team.

While at Nationals, they have 4 games, double round robin style. Their competitors are Ontario and British Columbia. After each game, they are provided with a sequence of carbohydrates to bring their sugar levels back to normal. They are given a banana, half a bagel, and a Gatorade. They actually have to consume it in that exact order to ensure effective nutrition. They will also have some training sessions throughout the week as well as a few team bonding activities.

Her position on the field is a scrumhalf. A scrumhalf is usually a short person (which she definitely is) and can think fast on their feet. The job of the scrumhalf is mainly decision-making and setting up plays. Plays are coordinated plans of moving the ball in a quick manner with the intention to score a try (points scored by putting the ball down in the end zone under control). The scrumhalf also does the majority of passing in the game (kind of like the quarterback in American football--but better. Just kidding. It's probably equally as difficult).

Last year, Nationals took place in Vancouver, B.C. Their team placed 3rd. They hope to win the title of National Champions this year.

I am 17 years of age and motorcycle road racing is my passion.
Currently a Year 12 at Hagley College, alongside this I am enrolled at Ara Institute of Canterbury studying Automotive & Engineering. I am also working part-time.
Back in 2011 I began training at my local track aged 10 on an Aprilia 50cc. I progressed to a 150cc machine and soon gained podium results. For the past 3 years I have been awarded the Motorcycling Canterbury “most improved rider” award. A proud achievement, as they are the most successful road racing club in the country. I was granted special dispensation from the sport’s governing body to compete in the 2015 National Championship, even though I was under the age limit.
In 2017 I won the NZ Junior development title. I am currently 2nd in the 2018 NZSBK 250 championship. Team Kiwistars are supporting me this year, and have offered me a position to ride for them in the 300 Supersport class for 2018/19. They have helped many other young riders achieve numerous New Zealand titles, and success in NZ, Australia & Europe.
I strive for improvement and like to represent myself, my sponsors and my team in a professional manner. This new opportunity gives me a chance to take my riding and presentation to another level. It brings many new challenges. One of which is to seek personal sponsorship to help me with the financial obligation that have towards my racing. I contribute most of my personal earnings towards racing.
I really appreciate you taking the time to read this introduction. Please do not hesitate to contact me or the team if you like any further information.  I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully representing you in the future.",11.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,0.0,14.0

The UPEI synchronized swimming team is made up of truly dedicated athletes.  Not only are they full time students, many of whom live on their own and work to pay the bills, but they also spend countless hours a week training in and out of the water. And if that isn't enough, add in several hours of fundraising each week. 

The University of Prince Edward Island is one of the smallest universities in the Canadian University Synchro League, and yet we have achieved fabulous results.  Last year we took the league by surprise, having every routine place in the top 3 at Nationals, and winning the trophy for the highest overall points!

I have several boxers in their journeyman stage where they require more bouts and wins before qualifying to fight in venues popularly shown on TV abroad like (Japan, EU, UK, Australia, Vegas, and many other popularly known venues). My main goals this year are: to have all members of my boxing team rank in the top 100 in the world at the end of the year and to be in a championship main event.
My journey of being a boxing promotor has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I have been many amateur and pro boxing competitions where I learned so much more about the sport. To become a world-class athlete, our team members have to push their limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, they want more and they know they can do more. They are ready to push their limits even further because I know they all can work their way to a championship bout. In order to do so, we must have our own promotion funded through private sources because there is little government support or corporate sponsorship. 
To be able to reach these goals this year I have to pay $6000. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my fees and promotional expenses.

The Crusaders have been around since 2005, having participated in all the editions of the Portuguese Football League, with multiple and consecutive podium finishes, but always falling short of the long-awaited championship. We work every year to better our athletes and training conditions, while also trying to improve our community by working with the municipality, schools and parish.
With very little funding, our athletes pay almost entirely for everything we need for the season. The average cost of a season for a football player is 250€, not taking into account training camps, trips for away games, replacing old gear, getting better training facilities and the overall development of the club. Also, players that are in the team for more than 1 year have to pay for their own gear. With this in mind, we have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you!
Our main priority will be to replace old and worn out helmets and shoulder pads for the new players arriving for this season, as this is definitely a safety issue. The first 1.500€ of this campaign will be directed to this issue. From there on, we hope to be able to get more training equipment, specific for our sport: shields, dummies, sleds, tackle wheels, etc. These will be the next 1.500€ of this campaign. If we can get as much support as we have dreamed of, we will invest the rest of the money to buy a container to properly store our equipment.

I wouldn't say I'm an amazing runner but i would consider myself a determined one. When i put my mind into doing something its a task i really will do and retry until its complete
My journey of being a runner has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I never thought i would do a 100 Miler race but i did it..
The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can do more, and hence the quest for Barkleys.
So the Barkley Marathon, I would say is the hardest ultra marathon ( Trail ), from all my research.
Below is a article from Runners world
When the Course Wins: No Finishers at the 2018 Barkley Marathons
https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a20866366/no-finishers-at-2018-barkley-marathons/ 
So just a couple of things i would like to state up front :)..
1) I am currently on the waiting list, within the top 6, so the odds of me getting a spot this year are quite high, if not this year there is next year.
2) Entry process is a secret and you will need to find out how to enter and do your own research. I wont be giving any hints or information so please don't ask how to enter etc,
3) The video is a trailer about the race, you can see the movie here http://barkleymovie.com/ ( I was not in and cannot take credit for any of this material ), but it will give you context into what Barkleys is all about.
So this is why I need your support, to try do what no-one could last year, make sure the course doesn't win. All donations will directly help me fund my journey and any supply's i may need along the way. By contributing you will help me reach my goals but you will also take part in my journey to the other half of the world, from Africa to the USA.",3.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,6.0

Team SA attended their first World Team Championships (WTC) in 2001 in Canada. Since this the sport has grown in leaps and bounds. Teams were then sent to the WTC USA in 2003, Belgium in 2008, England in 2009, France 2014 and USA 2015. SA hosted the first ever Southern Hemisphere Championships (SHC) in 2010, to which New Zealand and Australia were invited. An SA team was then sent to New Zealand in 2011 and Australia in 2012. The competition then returned to SA in 2013 where the South African team was Victorious over New Zealand and Australia. The purpose of this competition was to develop riders and help them gain competition experience before competing at WTC level against countries where the sport is at a highly professional level and more established. The SHCs have now grown and become the Nations Championships, with Burkina Faso, Iran, USA and Canada joining in. We are also currently supporting some development riders, whose costs are completely covered by MGASA.
On behalf of MGASA I would like to know if you would be interested in any form of sponsorship. The rewards for the company will be international branding, as well as exposure at the local fundraising events.
Sponsoring either kit or money to assist with the travelling expenses is required. Either of these options would be greatly appreciated. If you chose to donate money, I will ask for your company logo so we can get in embroidered or printed on our riding shirts.

I am a Professional Golfer currently living in South Africa.
The life of a professional athlete is based on health, finances and results.
Many professional golfers have the ability, but lack of sponsorships can end careers before they ever truly begin.
I turned professional in 2006 and although my parents didn’t have the money to assist, they made a plan and did what was needed to give their son a chance. Up and down results followed for a few years and although my name was in lights ever so often, the results were inconsistent.
Chatting to many sports psychologists, I soon realized that the inconsistency was due to tremendous pressure which the guys that were doing well, simply didn’t have.
I found a gentleman in the U.S that was willing to give me that opportunity and provide me with a sponsorship to play events on the mini tours in the States. He would cover my expenses and in turn, I would give him 80% of all my earnings that were made.
The success began instantly, the first event was a 2nd place in South Carolina followed by a 3rd and then another 2nd and before I knew it, I was competing week in and week out. I soon realized that without the pressure I had previously faced, I could compete at the highest level. The golf results were phenomenal until the sponsor decided to put his funding into another business venture and I was left stranded in the middle of a season.
I began searching for anyone else that could assist. Eventually I had no other option but to return to South Africa.
I had to find a job to make enough money to pay for my golf however the job became my life and golf had to take the back seat.
The hunger and talent has never gone away, and I have decided to give it a final go while I still can.
 I ask for your support with any contribution that you can make to help me get back to where I am meant to be. 
Who knows, you could be the person that helped the next superstar.
Kind Regards

Kieran

There are four teams that is earmarked to be participating from Cape Town and it is for this reason we need your help. Average cost per player is  $3000 which includes, flights, accommodation, meals and all transport requirements whilst competing. As you can see we have a long way to go in a short time. Competition is in April 2020 and we are scheduled to leave on March 30th. All deposits must be in November 30th 2019.

It is extremely difficult to motivate amateur footballers who already have so little to now in addition pay membership fees to ensure football for another year. In addition Cape Town has suffered a horrible drought which has crippled a large amount of our fields making it difficult for football to thrive in our community. 
I would like to see my clubs 1st team restored to its former glories but to do so we need support to raise funds so that we can cover necessary operational costs and in addition be able to ensure that our team has boots for each player and decent kit to play in for home games. 
When we travel to away games we are forced to cover transport costs which is often exspensive and this is made even more difficult when our 1st team players can barely afford to get themselves to the field let alone pay for transport to a field easily 40km away.

Every year, the loop of stored snow in Canmore called Frozen Thunder has attracted more and more interest from ski racers and coaches from across the country. We saw this as a unique setting to create a camp that not only helps kids to become better racers, but to inspire future National Team skiers and Olympic Champions. From October 20-26th, junior athletes from Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, BC and the Yukon will be training and living side by side. They will be training with and learning from our National Team athletes. They will be fine tuning their technique with some of the best coaches we have ever had in Canada. Most importantly, they will be building friendships that will last the rest of their lives. We want to create a platform that inspires these young athletes to do great things in sport and life. Your support will go directly into camp rewards and recognition to complement the professional expertise in place. Our goal is to raise enough money to supply the athletes with some cool camp shirts and hats that highlights their accomplishment and participation. We also want to provide some special awards (Suunto HR monitor, poles, roller skis) that recognize leadership skills and hard work.

I am here because I want to realize my childhood-dream: to hike around the world.
After I finished school I decided to work for the Staint John‘s ambulance, later for the Red Cross. It was not nice to cut people out of there accidental cars, to evacuate many thousands of people because someone has found a dud bomb from the first and the second world war, to found death bodies inside of a bush.
In 2017 I decided to go to Australia. Where I was there I worked a lot and travelled bit. The salary was not good and I had to pay a lot for the accommodation.
My dream is to hike around the world. I don’t know how many years I need for this. But it doesn’t matter if it’s 7 or 10 years.
While I am hiking I want to write books about my journey to give other people the chance to join me and to motivate people to travel healthy.
You can help me and donate just $1. All donated will directly help me to fund my dream.

As Muay Thai is not an Olympic sport, this tournament is the highest level of international amateur competition for Muay Thai athletes. With over 100 countries sending athletes to compete in the various divisions, it's a true test of skill and will against the world's best. I eat, sleep, and breathe the sport of Muay Thai, and I can't wait to meet this challenge head-on!

I am looking for support during the May 1 - May 10, 2014 tournament and greatly appreciate any help friends, family, teammates, and supporters of sport can offer. Your support will help me with approximately 2 weeks of living expenses during travel and in Malaysia, as well as with the costs of training for success. This will help me cover food and ground transportation, supplements and vitamins, training equipment, and training. You support also helps with tournament registration costs, and the cost of the tournament uniform. With your help I'll be able to take my athletic career to the next level and represent Canada on the world stage!

Every little bit counts and I am very grateful for the support of my friends, family, and supporters of sport!

I've decided to donate 25% of contributions over my initial goal to the Calgary chapter of KidSport which helps kids with financial barriers become involved in sports! The remainder will be used to help fund my 2014 amateur athletic career!
Thanks!

Scott MacKenzie and Meaghan Cameron have been training very hard for this opportunity, under Ajarn Mike Miles at Mike Miles Muay Thai and Kickboxing in Calgary, and are aiming to bring home two title belts. 
Scott is looking to extend his amateur record of 14 wins - 2 losses - and 11 KOs. He was victorious at the 2015 WKA USA Nationals in Richmond, Virginia, and is looking to defend his spot as champion of the supermiddleweight division.
It will be Meaghan's first time competing at the WKA USA Nationals and she is excited to continue gaining experience and exposure abroad. She is looking to further her fight career and extend her amateur record of 5 wins - 1 loss. Meaghan is the current IKF World Classic Lightweight Champion, and is looking to add a WKA belt to her list of accomplishments.
Unlike other sports which are in the Olympics, amateur Muay Thai athletes receive no direct funding from large sports organizations or the government. Competing at the highest levels in amateur Muay Thai is funded by the athlete, and travel and competition costs are often prohibitively expensive. Your support enables us to compete with the best and pursue our dreams of representing our gym and Canada abroad.
Your assistance will help Team Miles cover the following expenses associated with the competition*. We have been doing fundraising events for the Calgary Amateur Kickboxing Muay Association non-profit which is reimbursing most of the cost of our expenses.:
Breakdown of Funds Needed
Costs of travel, accommodation, tournament licence and registration (2 athletes, 1 coach): $3,756 CAD

The goal of this fundraising campaign is to help cover the costs of flying four athletes and one coach from Mike Miles Muay Thai and Kickboxing in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to Richmond, Virginia, USA, for the 2015 WKA Nationals tournament which is taking place March 20-22, 2015. The team will fly out on Thursday, March 19 and fly back on Monday, March 23.

As amateur athletes we must take on significant costs for the opportunity to compete at an international level against the best competitors in our divisions. The WKA nationals tournament provides a great venue for us to showcase our skills and gain valuable experience and wins!
Whether you are a part of Team Miles, the family or friend of one of the Team, or just a supporter of the sport, your help is greatly appreciated!
I will be using the funds for:
All money raised will be used to support the travel and success of four athletes and two coaches:

1. Return flights from Calgary to Richmond, Virginia costing approximately $750 / athlete + one coach
2. Tournament registration fees ($80 US / athlete), 2015 WKA Fighter License ($25 US / athlete) and 2015 WKA Cornerman Licenses ($15 US for coach)
3. Hotel accommodations in Richmond, Virginia near the venue for four nights costing approximately $825 US (3 rooms for 4 nights)
4. Food to fuel our success (3 meals / day / athlete & coach + snacks) ~ $50-60 US / day / fighter & coach

As you can see, the financial costs associated with competing abroad are substantial (Approx. $3750 CAD and $2720 US totaling approx. $6470 CAD), making your support crucial to the success of our team. All money raised during the duration of the campaign will be used for the above mentioned costs. Should there be any remaining funds they will be donated to charity, to the Calgary chapter of KidSport.

The fighters and coach attending the 2015 WKA Nationals tournament greatly appreciate your contribution to our success, we couldn't do it without you!
Your contribution means:
Your contribution to our trip to the WKA Nationals in Richmond, Virginia, USA means that we will be able to continue to pursue our athletic goals in the sport that we love so much!

Quick update, Covid has pushed this event into the later part of the fall.  No confirmed date yet but its still happening!
My name is Craig Nadeau and I am from Calgary, AB, Canada. I'm only 3 years into the sport of Physique bodybuilding. I have done very well in my last 3 competitions and have qualified for a Canadian National Pro Qualifier show in Toronto on July 31, 2020. (http://www.rudyproductions.ca/)
Tough part is with the Covid crisis, we are all facing income cuts and are training in basements and garages.  My plan is to win and get a Pro Card.  I have to pay for flights, coaches, food, tanning, hotel, entry fees.  I can cover much of it but .....
Best part is I am 52 and plan on overshadowing all the youngsters that show up for the show.

      My name is malia riordan and I am from Minnesota. I am truly passionate about Volleyball, and have been playing the sport I fell in love with upcoming on five years. My goal is to become the best athlete I can, and eventually  play for my dream school, the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon  
    To succeed, I need to be able to be recruited, and start playing club volleyball for a travel team. Being recruited  is very hard to do especially playing for a small, local team like I do. I would love to be able to play for a better known club team, but unfortunately the costs of these teams range from 6-7 thousand dollars to play for. Sometimes this doesn’t include travel. With all the hours of hard work and commitment I’ve put in, I think it’s unfair to myself and all the other athletes like me who are limited by financial cost and are unable to play to their full abilities. 
       With the help of you and my community, I intend to use this money to pay for my team cost at Mizuno Northern Lights for the season of 2020-2021. Mizuno Northern Lights is a very well known club that provides outstanding coaching and has had so many accomplished alumni, many of which went on to play after college in the pros overseas.

Over the past five seasons the Burlington Community High School Boy's Track and Field Family has been working toward changing the culture and climate within our school hallways and the community as a whole. It was only a few years back in history when our school was regarded as one of the leaders within the State of Iowa in academics, the arts and athletics. A disconnect between those ""glory days"" and present time has been created and the chasm widens with each passing day. A time existed when a child would come up through the school district wanting to be a Grayhound. As that individual grew older and had children of their own, those young ones were raised to wear purple and gold.
Those times have passed and the pride in the school that once existed has dissipated due to an increase in drop-out and failure rates, cuts in classroom offerings and teaching positions, and year after year of losing athletic teams has fallen to an all-time low. Kids walk the halls without purpose. Without pride.
I see athletic looking kids walk the halls but not participating in sports. When I ask them why, they look at me and say, ""Why should I waste my time practicing for a losing team when the coach already knows who is going to play?"" When my two-person staff and I explain the simple truth about track and field...that the clock and the tape do not lie and that allows the best person to compete no matter what their last name might be...it has lead us to start each of the past five seasons with a roster of more than 70 student-athletes (the largest Boys program at BHS). Our goal for this year is 100 boys out for track and field.
With a roster of that size comes additional expenses in the form of uniforms, travel, meals and coaching. As a program we strive to create opportunities for our team to experience all that our sport can offer. Overnight travel to meets in other States, team meals, and a true family atmosphere are some of the activities our team looks forward to every season.
Over the past five years there are many things the Boy's Track and Field Family has accomplished that make me proud.
100% graduation rate (for a couple boys it was close though)
13 of our alumni are continuing to compete at the college/university level
Grade and attendance checks are conducted weekly, those not passing do not travel
Iowa State Championships and Drake Relays qualifiers in each year
Two-time State High Jump Champion Justin Randall
31 competitors at the State Championships
Changing the environmental attitude takes time, energy and desire. We are raising funds so that our program can install a Boy's Track and Field specific trophy case to highlight our past and future, to afford travel to meets where each team member has a chance to compete and to enjoy being a part of this program. With our high roster numbers, travel to enough meets to allow everyone to compete becomes a challenge. Not all of our student-athletes can afford proper footwear or clothing. Our program history has been shaped by those who ran before us, our future will be as bright as we allow. We are asking for your support and to help spread the word! Please team up with us!

On behalf of each and every current student-athlete wearing purple and gray, our coaching staff and the alumni who paved the way...thank you for taking the time to read this and for your support of the Burlington High School Boy's Track and Field Family!

I'm asking for your support in my journey to represent Ireland at the World Surfing Games 2022. A Paris 2024 Olympic Qualifier.
Our team is Una, Maia, Holly, Gearoid, Tom and myself. We will all travel to California where it will be hosted this September, at Huntington Beach. We all must self-fund for this trip and raise contributions to cover flights, accommodation and other competition expenses.
As surfing grows in Ireland and settles in its Olympian status, Olympic funding streams will open. We're determined to represent as Irish Ambassadors of sport, and lay foundations for future teams to have stronger support structures.

My Motivation to Compete
I have a strong sense of duty to compete for Ireland and what drives me is sharing what I discover. I'm the National coach for the Irish Junior Surf Team, and I coach in the Northwest of Ireland in the Bundoran-Donegal-Sligo area. I'm invested in creating knowlege and pathways that create more value in peoples surfing - from professional athletes to children and adults of anylevel. Competitors or not.
I deeply believe competition is hard wired through our behavioural genetics, at every age level, and leveraging this wiring in specific ways creates space to be creative, and discover ideas. This creative space allows the imagination to unlock physical possibilities, of which more complex forms of play emerge. Play and joy - growing the capacity to experience clarity in moment by moment awareness of physical practise. This I believe is the key to greater potential for olympian capacities, OR - in developing a curious life-long relationship with physical practise.
My hope then, is to bring home from WSG22, ideas and connections for building a unique surf culture across Ireland. I would like to ask your help in supporting this.

How can you help?
We're seeking your help in two ways:
1. Please donate whatever you can to help us reach our trip target of €5,000
2. Please share our fundraising campaign on your social media channels and with your friends and fellow surf fans!

Thank you
I believe your collective support will help build the future of Irish Surf Culture. I'm motivated to lay pathways for young and talented surfers in Ireland to unlock their physical potential, and discover a life long relationship with their practise. Which will support the growth and diversity of Irish surf towns and local businesses.
Thanks,

The Argentine economy is in a dire state at the moment, with the Argentine Peso being devaluated more and more each day.

Our aim is to build a covered hitting facility where we can train in the winter season and avoid skipping practices because of bad weather.
How much does it cost? Around 8.000 USD.
What will it be used for? To train in the winter season and to avoid cancelled or suspended practices in the baseball season.
How big it is? About the size of 3 batting cages. So we can hit and do the bullpen and some fielding drills inside.
What is the status of it? As we already needed a place to train in the beginning of November we have called for help from all members of our organization. Everybody got involved, got their hands dirty and put in a lot of their free time to make this happen. As a result the hitting and training place has been built and we already started to use it. We still need to put new turf in it and some extra equipment needs to be bought so that we can use it properly.
But we have used all the money the organization had and even asked for loans from everybody. So now we need to get our investment at least partially back. To ensure that we have the funds to compete in 2020.

Cholnoky Sára vagyok, olimpikon szörf versenyző. Jelenleg a 2020-as olimpiára készülök, melyre már 2019-ben a garda-tavi világbajnokságon kivívtam az indulási jogot. A 2016-os riói olimpián szintén RS:X (szörf) kategóriában képviselhettem Magyarországot.
A jelenlegi felszerelésünket a 2024-és olimpián a Starboard iQFoil váltja le, mely egy szárnyas szörf, tehát a víz felett lehet vele siklani. Az új Foil irányzat meghatározója a szörf sportnak az elmúlt években.
Ugyan az elmúlt 10 évben megnyertem az RS:X magyar bajnokságot és Magyarország első számú női szörföse vagyok, sajnos sem a szövetségnek, sem nekem nincs anyagi forrásom ezt az új felszerelést megvásárolni. A külföldi versenytársaim már tudnak gyakorolni az új felszereléssel, melyről én sem szeretnék lemaradni.
Kérlek, amennyiben szeretnél és lehetőséged van rá, támogasd a felkészülésemet.

Hey! We are Unger Máté and Matics Krisztián from Hungary. We are competing mostly on K-2 200 and 500metres.
We have been doing kayaking for almost a decade. It has been the biggest part of our lives, and througtout the years both of us won national championships. Last year we came in 3rd in the Junior K-2 200m selection.
The reason, why we created this #-MakeAChamp campaign, is that we don't have any sponsors, neither our club, that could support us to reach our goals.
We have been working together from the beginings, but only competing together since 2011. Last year, we became the part of one of the best teams in Hungary. We have an Olympic Champion in the team, so we have the professional background for the success, unfortunately ""only"" the money is missing for it.
Hungary is one of the best kayaking countries in the world, so it's very difficult to qualify for an international competition, but if you invest a lot of hard work in it, it will hopefully pay off, and THAT's what we exactly do! We train hard every day, and give all the best we can even if its summer or winter, racing or training!
In 2014, we stepped up an ageclass, so we bacame U23 athletes. This shift was really tough for us, but in the national championships we came in 7th both in the K2 200 and 500 meters. Now, we are looking forward for next year's competitions.
The preparation for 2015 has been started from September. In Spring, we would like to go for a traingcamp to Sevilla, Spain, because in Hungary the begining of Spring is too cold for quality trainings on water. The camp would last 3 weeks, so that means it's quite expensive...
The goal for 2015 is the European Canoe Sprint Juniors and U23 Championships, which will take place in Bascov-Budeasa in Romania.
The next Olympic Games in Rio, would be an unrealistic goal for us, because we are too young for it, so our huge goal is to qualify for the 2020s Olympic Games to Tokyo and to bring home the gold medal to Hungary.
2020 is so far away yet, and we are taking the preparation step-by-step! Our next step is to travel to Sevilla, and to start 2015 on top because the first big challenge is coming in May, at Szeged, Hungary!
With Your support, and the money raised through Makeachamp, we would be able to travel to Sevilla, and we could start the year on TOP and would be able to qualify for the European Championships!
I will be using the funds for:
We would like to use the funds for a 3 week Spring training camp in Sevilla, Spain. This would include the plane tickets, accomodation, food and to borrow the necessary sporting goods (kayaks,paddles), if we are not able to transport ours.
The camp and the transportation cost a lot of money, that we can't afford.
Your contributions will allow for the camp to be possible.
Your contribution means:
Your support means the world for us, and every dollar could help us!

We appreciate every assistance, and we will be really grateful for all Your support!

Whether it's a contribution or a share, we are going to appreciate and acknowledge it.

I’m Sara Mihalik, a 21 year-old sprint kayaker, multiple National champion and I am a member of the National  Development (U23) Team of Hungary. Sprint kayaking is my passion and my long term goal is to represent my country at the Olympic Games in Tokyo.
Similar to the last few racing seasons, 2017 has been going very well so far: I participated at the U23 World Championships (4th place), at the European Championshiops (2nd and 7th place) and now I am preparing for the Marathon World Championship which will be held in South Africa on the 7-10th of September.
In 2016 I came home from the Marathon World Championships with a silver and a bronze medal. My dream is to bring home a gold medal as a World Champion.
And that is why I need your help:
As an elite athlete, I devote all my time and energy to training in order to make my goals attainable. Life of an up and coming Olympic hopeful athlete has its financial limitations and the demands of my sport require significant expenditures.
To fulfil my goals first of all I would need now the latest edition of a racing boat. As I do both sprint and marathon kayaking I need two kinds of boats with the same price (4000$). Earlier this year with the help of kind and generous supporters I could buy a sprint kayak. But marathon kayaks are a way different thing (different in their weight, fabric etc). To be able to continue my marathon career I defenetly need a marathon kayak boat.
Beside the expensive lifestyle of professional sport me and my parents are not in a position to finance my training camps abroad (where the weather is good for kayaking in winter) and the 4000$ for my new boat any longer.
Beside kayaking I am studying Agricultural Engineering at Szent Istvan University in Hungary. That means I have absolutely no time to make my living and to my greatest regret in my country universities do not support their athlete-students with sports scholarships.
As you may know, Hungarian kayakers are (one of) the best ones in the world - we have an unbroken tradition of Olympic champions of female kayaking. Therefore, to qualify for any international (not to mention Olympic) championships is extremely difficult and every detail counts : paddle, boat, training camps, vitamins..etc.
My best results so far:
 Olympic Hopes Competition:
2011 - K4 3rd place
2012 - K2 2nd, 3rd place
2013 - K1(=single kayak) 4th place
U23 Marathon World Championship:
2016 - K1 2nd place
Senior Marathon World Championship:
2016 - K2 3rd place
U23 European Championship:
2016 - K1 500m 6th place
2017 – K1 1000m 2nd place
             K1 500m 7th place
U23 World Championship:
2017 – K1 1000m 4th place
 With your contribution you are helping me to achive my goals : to overstep my limits, to make my small and little-known country more famous, proud and last but not least happier :)
Helping me in terms of potential sponsors would mean a lot to me. Each donation is greatly appreciated :)

My main goals this year are: to be in the top 5 in Romania at amateur level at the end of the season and to be on the podium.
My journey of being 2 years ago and has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I have been to some amateur competitions, where I learned so much more about my sport. To become a complete athlete I had to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way onto a podium.

My name is Léo Baeten and I am an Ice dancer from Brussels, Belgium. Ice dance is a discipline which combines sport and art, for me it is a way to express myself, express my feelings and to tell a story to the people that are watching me. For almost two years now, I have been training in some of the best training centers in the world, in countries such as France and Russia in order to become the best athlete I can. 
An usual training day consist of two practices on ice, one dance class and one hour of physical preparation. Then I get home, I stretch and I start studying for my classes at university. As I dont live in Belgium I do university at home. I train 5-6 days a week and then we have one day of rest.
I am a very dedicated and motivated athlete. I'm focused on my road and I know what I want. Ice dance is a sport  with little audience therefore its very difficult to find sponsors.I know the cost are high and I hope that by supporting me today, together we can hope to represent my country at the european, world an maybe one day, the Olympic level.

Both teams have a had a great regular season! After the Standford Invite and Northwest Challenge that included victories against UCLA, U Washington, Sonoma State, Colorado and Stanford, the women are currently ranked 4th (of 165).  After tournaments in Santa Barbara, San Diego, and Austin that included victories against Stanford, Arizona, Berkley, and UCSB, the med are ranked 23rd (of 276). The hard work in every practice and tournament has built up two skilled and determined teams that are contending with the best college teams in the world.  Our next goal is to win our region and return to Nationals. We need your help to keep this success rolling!

Whether it's flights to our next tournament in Texas, hotels in Washington State, or a trip to Nationals in Ohio, costs all add up. We also have practices three times per week, we run track workouts, we're lifting in the gym, and we're all full-time students. Our student athletes work extremely hard to balance education, athletics, and the jobs needed to fund it all.  

Your donation will be used to offset the costs that are considered ""team"" costs including field rentals for practices, jerseys, hotels, car rentals at remote tournaments, and travel costs for our coaches. These generally total approximately $500 per player per season. This is in addition to each player's travel costs that they are personally responsible for.

My name is josh and I am from Bridgetown , Barbados. I am truly passionate about Running, which I exercise as often as I can. My goal is to become one of the best athletes in my sport, and I need your help to turn the impossible into a reality.
 I am an up and coming middle distance track/ road runner seeking to make it to a higher level of international competition.

I am a national champion in the 5000m (2014-2018) & 3000m (2013-2014, 2018).
My personal best :( 15:18, 5000m) (3:57, 1500m) (8:41 road 3000m during covid) (34:33 10k) (1hr17:35 half marathon) (1:53 800m)

So far though I have had opportunity to represent my country regionally at the junior level at the Carifta Championships three times (2014-2015) where I came out with a bronze in my last year. I have also had the opportunity to be at the International Military Sports Council (CISM) Games which was held in Mungyeong, South Korea in 2015, I have competed in some races in neighbouring islands where I've either won and or didn’t make it to the top three respectively.

I take part in several mini road and track races and a half marathon each year with great success. I know I can compete at a bigger level. 



Unfortunately, as with the nature of this sport, I have had a few injuries that impacted my performance during the  2018-2019 season but I have recovered well. I have just recently found a new Coach . Her name is Danielle Filipek an accomplished runner, Olympian and a great person and training is going well.

Currently 2020 like most of us, all my key races and events have been canceled,  however the grind has not stopped , with a chance of my only time to compete coming this October 2020 in which i get to defend my teams triathlon relay title I aim to give it my all.

My aim for the remaining of the year is to keep training as norm and to push my limits with the goal of getting prepared to attack my  country's national records in 2021. Tho my dream is to represent at the Olympic Games eventually, 2021 realistically would not be my time however i still aim and train as i were to make the standards. 

I am seeking sponsors and support to provide various things needed to keep me in optimum condition and at peak performance. Among my requirements are supplements and gear to help me through the remainder of the year so I can make it into the 2021 season as healthy as possible.

Fellow athletes and genuine supporters who can offer training advice and other tips to help me along the way are all welcomed. 

At this current venture I need assistance in acquiring recovery equipment and training gear. 

Thank you all for your consideration and time to help me keep moving forward . I greatly appreciate it",5.0,1.0,2.0,18.0,2.0,15.0

I am an up and coming middle distance track/ road runner seeking to make it to a higher level of international competition.

I am a national champion in the 5000m (2014-2018) & 3000m (2013-2014, 2018).
My personal best :( 15:18, 5000m) (3:57, 1500m) (8:55, 3000m) (34:33 10k) (1hr17:35 half marathon) (1:53 800m)

So far though I have had opportunity to represent my country regionally at the junior level at the Carifta Championships three times (2014-2015) where I came out with a bronze in my last year. I have also had the opportunity to be at the International Military Sports Council (CISM) Games which was held in Mungyeong, South Korea in 2015, I have competed in some races in neighbouring islands where I've either won and or didn’t make it to the top three respectively.

I take part in several mini road and track races and a half marathon each year with great success. I know I can compete at a bigger level.



Unfortunately, as with the nature of this sport, I have had a few injuries that impacted my performance during the  2018-2019 season but I have recovered well. I have just recently found a Coach . Her name is Danielle Filipek an accomplished runner and great person and training is going well.

Currently 2020 I am training and preparing myself for the following upcoming events in the light of Covid19 and the reopening of races and running recently in Barbados.

Run Barbados Series, it's the biggest road race series for Barbados in December, I'll be stepping down from the 10k to tackle the mile, 5k and half marathon over the course of 3days.

I am seeking sponsors and support to provide various things needed to keep me in optimum condition and at peak performance. Among my requirements are supplements and gear to help me through the remainder of the year so I can make it into the 2021 season as healthy as possible.

I am also looking for persons and other athletes who can offer training advice and other tips to help me along the way.

To excel, I need to constantly push my limits. I am ready to work hard, but at the same time, I know that the road to success will be costly. By supporting me you're changing my life. Thank you for your support!

I'm really excited as I've been offered a Rugby scholarship in the US to study my Sports science Degree.
I started playing Rugby as a hobby when I was 4 at my local Brentwood Rugby club then played league for Brentwood EELS club and then finally found my home at Old Brentwood’s. 
After completing my BTEC in Sports Science, I have been very lucky to have been awarded a Rugby Scholarship in the US. This will mean I will be moving abroad to a college in Massachusetts to study my Sports Science 4 year Degree.
To be able to reach this goal, I have to pay the balance of the Fees for my living/tuition and travel and this is why I'm reaching out for your support today. All of your kind donations will directly help me fund my opportunity in the US. Your contributions are vital as they will not only help me reach my potential in playing Rugby but also in achieving my Degree.
As a UK student studying abroad, I am not entitled to a UK student loan and in the US I am not entitled to any other funding so this is where your contributions will be so important as without them I face a huge challenge ahead. Despite a very generous scholarship, the balance of my Tuition Fees/Living & Travel costs are £15k
I would appreciate any support you can offer me in terms of funding as literally every £/$ counts and I am so grateful in advance for your help. I also aim to have a campus job whilst in the US to earn additional funding around my studies and training. 
In terms of advice for sponsorship or businesses who might be interested in following my progress over the next four years, I would be happy to hear from anyone who might be willing to support my journey either through financial funding or as a sports mentor. 
So that's the story so far...I have an exciting time ahead and a truly once in a lifetime opportunity which I intend to grab with both hands. It will be amazing to see what doors might open for me during and after my four years in the US and beyond. 
Once again, thanks so much for taking the time to read my story and please know that any funding given is much appreciated.

Dobrý deň,

volám sa Miroslava Argalášová a som mladá architektka a jazdkyňa na koni. Moje povolanie mi už necelé tri roky zabezpečuje slušnú životnú úroveň, no na starostlivosť o päťsto kilové zviera je to málo. Jazdím už pätnásť rokov a nikdy som nemala svojho koňa. Mám ale obrovské šťastie na ľudí. Vďaka tomuto šťastiu som mohla vo svojich šestnástich rokoch dva roky pretekať v parkúrovom skákaní. Vďaka rovnakému šťastiu mám teraz k dispozícii kobylu - Piano, s ktorou som po viac ako desiatich rokoch mohla opäť zažiť ten krásny pocit zo súťaženia.

Na našej prvej parkúrovej súťaži sme sa umiestnili na peknom štvrtom mieste.

Piano, šestnásťročná kobyla, je už pár mesiacov na predaj a ja celý čas rozmýšľam, ako nafúknuť vlastnú peňaženku, aby mohla byť moja. Trénujeme spolu od apríla a musím povedať, že náš vzťah je ako manželstvo. Druhým dychom dodávam, že lepšieho koňa som si ani nemohla predstaviť. Piano ešte v roku 2019 skákala na vysokých medzinárodných súťažiach a aj keď je to už pani v rokoch, zdravie a chuť súťažiť má stále rovnakú ako ktorýkoľvek mladý kôň. Desať mesiacov sme si na seba zvykali, trénovali a som si istá, že by sme toho spolu ešte veľa dokázali.

Vždy som chcela súťažiť. Celý život som jazdkyňou bez koňa. Cítim, že som čakala práve na Piano.

Jedinou šancou na splnenie môjho sna ste práve Vy. Verím, že ma šťastie na ľudí neopustí ani v tejto dôležitej chvíli. S veľkou vďakou prijmem príspevok v akejkoľvek výške. Vďaka vášmu príspevku si budem môcť kúpiť Piano bez toho, aby som sa zadlžila. Aj keď je to pre mňa stále neuveriteľné, sponzora na ročnú starostlivosť už máme! Chýba nám iba posledný malý krôčik.

Ja a Piano budeme zatiaľ ďalej trénovať, aby sme boli pripravené vyhrávať preteky v mene nás všetkých. Ak by ste chceli sledovať našu cestu, môžete sa prihlásiť na odber nášho nového IG @lets_get_piano. Budeme sa na vás tešiť. 

Ďakujem veľmi pekne za podporu a zdieľanie s rodinou a priateľmi.

Hello,

my name is Miroslava Argalasova, I am young architect and horse rider. My profession has provided me with a decent standard of living for three years now, but it is far not enough for both of us, me and a horse. I have been riding for fifteen years now and I have never had my own horse. But I got very lucky. Thanks to this luck, I was able to race in show jumping for two years at the age of sixteen. Thanks to the same luck, I can train on a mare - Piano, with which I was able to experience the beautiful feeling of competition again after more than ten years.

In our first show jumping competition, we placed in a nice fourth place.

Piano, a sixteen-year-old mare, has been on sale for a few months now, and I've been thinking all along how to earn more money so that she can be mine. We have been training together since April and I must say that our relationship is like a marriage. Still, I could not even imagine a better horse. Piano jumped in high international competitions back in 2019 and even though she is slowly growing old, her health and desire to compete is still the same. We have been training together for ten months and I am sure we could do a lot more.

I have always been a rider without a horse. I feel like all this time I have been waiting for her.

The only chance to fulfill my dream is you. I believe that my luck will not leave me at this important moment. Buying a horse and taking care of it is very financially demanding and that is why I would like to ask you for help. Any contribution will be very appreciated. Thanks to your contribution I will be able to buy Piano without putting myself in debt. This is the very last step we need to take so she can be officially mine. I honestly cannot wait to share our future together.

In a meantime, Piano and I will continue with our training so we are ready to win the shows and make you proud. If you would like to follow our journey, you can do that by subscribing to our brand new instagram account @lets_get_piano. I will be more than happy to welcome you there, in our little family.

Thank you very much for your support and sharing with your family and friends!

praticar seu esporte preferido, mas não sabem onde, quando e com quem.
Na sociedade atual, times e esportistas amadores enfrentam uma dificuldade crescente para encontrar com as características desejadas, peladas adequadas para jogar, times adversários para desafiar, jogadores para comporem suas equipes e torneios para disputar.  O problema é acentuado pela diminuição dos espaços à prática de esportes amadores no país, em função da especulação imobiliária; pela crescente mobilidade das pessoas, o que dificulta a integração social; e pela constante restrição de agenda.
Nesse cenário, objetivamos prover facilitação, entretenimento e informação, através de apoio para:
• busca de adversários para agendamento de confrontos
• ingresso em novas peladas
• identificação de jogadores para compor “elenco”
• identificação e gestão de torneios
• gerenciamento dos seus times e peladas
• busca por informações sobre o segmento
• exposição de suas experiências como peladeiros
A rede social é única, pois oferece ambiente personalizado por esporte e um mix de funcionalidades completo para ampliação da prática esportiva, melhoria da atividade e status esportivo; não existindo concorrente com perfil semelhante e abrangendo diversas modalidades. E é contemporânea, ao juntar o ambiente virtual social com a necessidade de interação real, num momento de efervescência do cenário esportivo brasileiro.

Sou o empreendedor à frente desse desafio e me chamo Guilherme Arja Castañon. Tenho 43 anos, sou formado em Marketing, pós-graduado em Administração Esportiva pela FGV e Gestão de Projetos pelo COPPEAD. Possuo 9 anos de experiência como diretor em agência de marketing digital, 10 anos como gerente de marketing em empresas do segmento de marketing esportivo e financeiro. Praticante e apaixonado por futebol e esportes. Presente como espectador nas Copas do Mundo da Alemanha e Brasil, e Olimpíadas de Londres.
Lancei essa campanha para dar suporte durante 12 meses, ao processo de reentrada no mercado, com o desenvolvimento de uma app, ajustes no escopo já implementado, implementação de novas funcionalidades e divulgação via marketing digital. Toda o recurso captado será integralmente investido nessas quatro ações, através das contratações de um desenvolvedor e um web designer, e de uma campanha de FaceAd.
O TimeContra.com possui hoje mais de 3 mil usuários entre times e jogadores, de todos os estados brasileiros, e nos 5 esportes atualmente disponíveis (futebol, basquete, vôlei, handebol e rugby). Nossa fanpage no Facebook possui 35 mil fãs e obtivemos o reconhecimento do mercado, com matérias nos principais veículos do país, como O Globo, Estado de São Paulo, GloboNews, entre outros. 
A rede social está no ar, mas o projeto está parado por falta de recursos. Ainda não possuo a robustez necessária para despertar o interesse de grandes empresas potenciais investidoras, e não consegui captar investimento com fundos especializados. Sem a ajuda de vocês, vou precisar matar esse sonho de vida e encerrar completamente o projeto.

Un de nos plus grand défi est le coût du championnat. Une saison de cheerleading compétitif, de niveau mondial, peut coûter environ 5 000$.

They have formed a tremendous bond that shows in the countless activities they share with one another that extend well beyond the basketball season. This group of girls and our program are up and coming and ready to make some waves in the Central League. Growing a program to the levels we expect to, takes time, effort and can be expensive. We want to provide these girls with a fantastic experience, win or lose. High school basketball teaches lessons that can't be learned anywhere else and these girls deserve to get the full experience possible. Those experiences include team dinners, team bonding events like laser tag, bowling, attending local college basketball games, travel gear, senior night, end of the year banquet, and anything else possible to make sure the girls enjoy their time on the team. With everything going on in the world right now fundraising to help off set the cost of these opportunities has become increasingly difficult, and that is where you can help. Please consider making a contribution to this campaign to help our girls have an experience they will never forget.

We have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! 
Starting last season the Conestoga Girls Basketball program started streaming games so those that were not able to attend could still support our great athletes. With everything that's going on with the pandemic and fans being limited in the gyms this streaming service has been a something that has kept us connected to family and friends that want to watch us play. This is where we are asking for your help. The video  service is not free and because we were unable to do some in person fundraising this season our funds are stretched to the max. Because so many people have used the service and it has provided such a benefit to everyone around our program we are asking you to help us raise money to cover the cost. Anything you could donate would be greatly appreciated. 
By contributing, you are supporting Conestoga Girls Basketball as an organization and its athletes. You are also becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, that is helping young athletes reach their dreams and achieve athletic excellence.

My name is Sydney Koevoet and I do judo! I have been participating in the sport for 9 years. I began when I lived in Ontario and In 2009 my family moved out West to a small community that did not have judo. After a year I decided that I really missed the sport and so my parents helped me to find a Dojo nearby. Unfortunately, the closest place was about an hour away in the town of Fernie BC (where I currently train). At this time I was certain that I wanted to continue participating in the sport of judo! Competing has always been a passion of mine, but two years ago, after competing in the BC Winter Games, this passion grew. Since then I have begun travelling much more to attend training camps and competitions. Because of where I live and train, many of these events are usually many hours away. Right now, I am training for my chance at taking the podium in the 2014 Canadian Judo National Championships and next year, hope to compete at the 2015 Canada Winter Games. For this event I am training an average of 3 times a week as well as cross fit training at home every other day of the week. With this campaign I hope to raise about $1500 which would cover my travel and competition fees for the 2014 Canadian Judo Nationals.

She took her first tennis steps on the ruined asphalt courts near her home in the outskirts of Belgrade, Serbia, holding her sister’s racket with both hands as it was too heavy for her, but she hasn’t complained, ever.
She quickly surpassed her peers and started playing against older girls.
She has always been passionate about tennis and at the age of 9.5 she was the youngest ball-kid ever to participate in the Davis Cup Finals in 2013 (Serbia - the Czech Republic).
At the age of 12 Andrea became the member of the Serbian National U12 Team. Since then she has played and won numerous tournaments, both domestic and International (in Europe).
This year she visited the famous Nikola Pilic Academy (Novak Djokovic’s coach during his teen days) for a successful 5-day observation session where he praised her talent, play and attitude.
Now, at 14, Andrea is more dedicated to success, she practices six days a week and still attends school regularly, as much as she can.
The time has come to continue towards a new milestone, playing and winning Junior ITF tournaments.
In order for Andrea to improve herself and gain experience on the road towards Pro WTA tennis, it is necessary that she plays at least 7-8 Europe Junior tournaments as well as few Junior ITF tournaments per year. We, as a family, can not afford this, having covered all the costs of daily trainings, domestic and international tournaments so far.
She needs help.
The predicted annual expenses are:
·        Coaching                              -  covered by the family

My brother and I have created a football club in GAMBIA (West Africa)

Created in 2020, UNION ATHLETIC is today the first structured club of the BASSE region, in the eastern part of the country.

Driven by the objective of ensuring the best development of the club, the 2021/2022 season will mark the starting point of the club's defined objectives:

- The accession and sustainability of the first team in the Gambian First Division

- The excellence of the academy (from U11 category to reserve team)

- The continued development of Gambian football in the eastern part of the country

- The accession of the first team to the CAF Champions League.

In order to achieve these goals, we have acquired a plot of fifteen hectares for our future training center, sports complex and FIFA standards stadium.

As part of this development which will help the entire region of Basse as much professionally and sportingly as socially, we are looking for partners and investors who will accompany us in this great adventure.

been taught that we learn only to earn that is what i have been doing all my life earning a degree getting a job etc  like a deligent ox the burnng inside the stomach is always greater than the burning inside the head you see but the ordeal started when i quit my job the deadly cycle started again  sitting for exams going for interviews getting rejected ++in between all this i started playing video games specially car racing games on my smart phone i used to be very good at playing video games in my school days so i started with this one and became quite proficient in it i was surprised to find that games nowadays are so real and life like i regret having missed playing them but life makes you so busy that you throw all your dreams in the dustbin i started to look online gaming competitions if they could help me earn some side income its difficult to manage if you are unemployed and living on your parent's pension money while going through different websites i found out about sim car racing   how sim car racers are transitioning into real world car racing and how real world racers are using sim car racing to train thus cost of fuel etc then i thought why shouldn't i try this myself ++so i looked up some motorsports websites and stumbled upon one ad on such a site the ad was for+jk tyre fmsci national karting championship   4 stroke+it was being

experienced the speed on the mobilescreen but the power of the real engine is really overwhelming you actually feel every bone and muscle in your body shaking and vibrating every curve puts a lot of force on your body no wonder motorsports is a very physically demanding sport but still i mustered up all my courage and walked towards the kart one of the organizer's staff started the engine and off we went to race +ín the first lap i somehow managed to accelerate and steer in the second the inevitable happened   my kart hit the tyre wall my engine shut off i was in sudden shock but as soon as i recovered i raised my hand and called the racing staff in the nearby post he came running to me and asked whether i want to race further i said  hell yes i hadnot travelled 1500 kms for sight seeing win or no win i finish the job i started so i had decided to complete the race as soon as the boy started my kart's engine i pressed the pedal as hard as i could braking at curves' entry taking larger arcs and exiting the curve with throttle full on intermittently braking so as not make the kart unstable doing one thing at a time i e braking  steering  accelerating exactly following the routine i had found on the web to reduce lap time taking full advantage of the straights i donot know how fast i was going by that time i had become habituated to the steering wheel the track was 400 m and there were four curves i only started to slowdown when i saw the chequered flag after that i coasted back to the finish line got out of the kart my whole body was trembling with from the adrenaline rush i took my helmet off and handed over my jacket at the counter thus ended my first race which had almost become a blurr by then i donot know if i turned any heads or made a mark or not but i did finish job when the results were declared i found my timing was 30 405 sec not bad for a 32 year old the fastest guys laptime was 22 sec who must have been 10 years younger than me i wish i were faster i didnot qualify +for a firs timer  it was very risky the kart could have overturned had i oversteered at high speed  yes i forgot to mention the brakes and accelerator were getting jammed

My name is debasish majhi and I am from Barbil, Odisha, India.
AmbitionToRaceFormula

Sports has the ability to inspire,educate & enthrall.All our lives we have been taught that we learn only to earn.That is what I have been doing all my life.Earning a degree,getting a job etc. like a deligent Ox.The burnng inside the stomach is always greater than the burning inside the head you see.But the ordeal started when I quit my job.The deadly cycle started again; sitting for exams,going for interviews,getting rejected.

In between all this I started playing video games specially car racing games on my smart phone.I used to be very good at playing video games in my school days.So,I started with this one and became quite proficient in it.I was surprised to find that games nowadays are so real and life-like.I regret having missed playing them.But life makes you so busy that you throw all your dreams in the dustbin.I started to look online gaming competitions if they could help me earn some side income.Its difficult to manage if you are unemployed and living on your parent's pension money.While going through different websites I found out about SIM car racing , how SIM car racers are transitioning into real world car racing and how real world racers are using SIM car racing to train thus cost of fuel etc.Then I thought why shouldn't I try this myself.

So,I looked up some motorsports websites and stumbled upon one ad on such a site.The ad was for
JK Tyre FMSCI National Karting Championship - 4 Stroke
It was being organised by MecoMotorsports in chennai.It didnot require any driving experience and was suitable for a begginer like me to enter the racing arena.So,I registered on the site.The registration fee was Rs.1500/-.I knew all racers have had some sort of karting experience in their early career.I found this as a good opportunity to show skills as a driver.The qualifying time trials were being held at ECR SPEEDWAY Chennai on 21st &22nd Dec,2019.So,I registered and took part.
I had played the video games pretty well but handling a real steering wheel is a different ballgame altogether.I had experienced the speed on the mobilescreen but the power of the real engine is really overwhelming.You actually feel every bone and muscle in your body shaking and vibrating.Every curve puts a lot of force on your body.No wonder motorsports is a very physically demanding sport.But still I mustered up all my courage and walked towards the kart.One of the organizer's staff started the engine and off we went to race.
Ín the first lap I somehow managed to accelerate and steer.In the second,the inevitable happened & my kart hit the tyre wall.My engine shut off.I was in sudden shock.But as soon as I recovered I raised my hand and called the racing staff in the nearby post.He came running to me and asked whether I want to race further.I said, hell yes.I hadnot travelled 1500 kms for sight seeing.Win or no win I finish the job I started.So,I had decided to complete the race.As soon as the boy started my kart's engine I pressed the pedal as hard as I could.Braking at curves' entry,taking larger arcs and exiting the curve with throttle full on,intermittently braking so as not make the kart unstable.Doing one thing at a time i.e braking ,steering &accelerating.Exactly following the routine I had found on the web to reduce lap time.Taking full advantage of the straights.I donot know how fast I was going.By that time I had become habituated to the steering wheel.The track was 400 m and there were four curves.I only started to slowdown when I saw the chequered flag.After that I coasted back to the finish line,got out of the kart.My whole body was trembling with from the adrenaline rush.I took my helmet off and handed over my jacket at the counter.Thus,ended my first race which had almost become a blurr by then.I donot know if I turned any heads or made a mark or not but I did finish job.When the results were declared I found my timing was 30.405 sec.Not bad for a 32 year old.The fastest guys laptime was 22 sec who must have been 10 years younger than me.I wish I were faster.I didnot qualify.
For a firs timer ,it was very risky.The kart could have overturned had I oversteered at high speed..Yes I forgot to mention the brakes and accelerator were getting jammed together i.e. if you pressed one pedal the other was getting pressed too. I cautiously avoided that situation
Now coming to the reason why I am actually doing this fundraiser.
There is a 2 day training is being conducted by FORMULA1RACING at KARI MOTOR SPEEDWAY ,Chennai on 6th and 7th Jan,2020.The details are as follows:
Professional Car driving Training
Training in Formula Car
Training by professional Racer
Training in Simulator(Kari Motors Track)
Food,Accomodation &Local Transport for those two days.
Best three persons will be given Free entry for Level II Training
Certificate
Training Fee Rs.22,500/- +GST
 
www.formularacing.co.in
 
I haven't registered on the website yet.I also enquired about level II training.They said its Rs.26,550/- +GST.Hope the academy is as good as the illustration they have provided on the website
FLIGHT COST, if I book 5days ahead would be around Rs.8,500 to and same for fro.Thats Rs.17000 to 20000. approx.
Would have preferred the railways as they are cheaper but I am a favorite target for railway gang robbers I donot know why.They look like normal passengers but their intention is to squeeze money out of their targets.I have been targeted four times by now but luckily I didnot have much money on my person so remain untouched.Once while going to Mumbai and once while this time going to chennai.Feels unsafe to travel by train.
 
LEVEL I:RS. 22500/-+GST
LEVEL II: RS.26550/-+GST
FLIGHT :Rs.20,000/-(Rs.10,000+Rs.10,000 worst case scenario) or
              Rs.8000 (Rs.4000+Rs.4000 best case scenario if booked 2 weeks ahead.)
 
Going by worst case scenario the Total cost comes down to Rs.69,050/-
Approx.Rs.69,100/-.Thats somewhere equivalent to $1000/-
 
If this fundraiser is a success I donot know where I might end. I hope to apply for my FMSCI competition License.Motorsports is still in a very nascent stage in India.There are good chances for growth with sponsors like JK TYRES ,MRF,MAHINDRA.

I really appreciate your time today and hope you will help us achieve some important goals.
We’re a basketball team of 24 males (16-19 years old) and we have been invited by the  Department of Recreation in Mount Vernon, New York, to take part in a number of positive social and athletic activities during the period: August 8-20.
Commissioner Morton from the Department of Recreation Department will be coordinating basketball clinics and a series games with local American teams for us. This will be extremely beneficial to us and ultimately our country since universities offering basketball scholarships will be present at some of these events.
We see this as an opportunity of a lifetime and that's why we need you on our team, too, even though you can’t block any shots or drain any three-pointers for us. Like many school programmes these days, our budget is very limited, so we need your help to help us fund this trip
That’s why I would be honored if you would contribute $50 or more, or whatever you can afford toward this campaign. Your support will help us pay air fare, hotel accommodation and meals for all players.
Your generosity really makes a difference to all of us.

I am lucky enough to have made the Alberta U18 rugby team. Please help me in reaching for my dream of playing with Team Alberta at nationals.  

Rugby Alberta will have four teams representing them at the 2014 Age Grade Nationals August 5 - 10, 2014. Each of these athletes has undergone an intense ID Camp, Regional Training Sessions, and a provincial competitions to make the short list of athletes. Each team consists of 24 athletes who will be striving to bring home gold medals. Age classifications are U18 Women, U18 Men, U16 Girls and U16 Boys.

This year the competition across the country is particularly tough so the athletes need all the help they can get! Support your Alberta athletes through your generous sponsorship. The minimum each athlete needs to raise is $1250 for their final payment towards the Championships. Families endure the financial burden of their athletes training, travel and meals up to this point and now ask for your financial support to take them to that Gold Medal.

For those that cannot support the athletes financially we ask that you spread the word about their fundraising endeavours through Make A Champ fundraising opportunity. Send them the link and get everyone involved in assiting these athletes.The staff and Board of Directors of Rugby Alberta want to wish each and every athlete the best of luck at the 2014 Age Grade Nationals.

My name is Martin Pasternak and I am from Syracuse New York. I am truly passionate about Obstacle Course Racing, which I participate as often as I can. My goal for 2020 is to participate in over 100 miles of Spartan Races while raising money for a non-profit here in Syracuse called ""The Reading League"". The Reading League focuses on supporting teachers throughout Central New York with the newest and best literacy practices in order to support our children.
For this cause I am ready to push myself farther than I ever have! I recently qualified for the Spartan World Trifecta Championship in Sparta Greece which will mean I need to push myself farther and harder than ever before.

Somos um casal, Alexandra Lopes e Pedro Sousa, residentes em Vagos - Aveiro, vimos desta feita apresentar o projeto e solicitar o vosso patrocínio/apoio na prática desportiva de Downhill, uma modalidade do Mountain Bike, pela qual o nosso filho Simão Pedro, com apenas 7 anos, demonstra um grande interesse e um extraordinário potencial.


Acreditamos na capacidade de mobilizar um projeto piloto além fronteiras.

O Simão, com o nosso apoio, procura pela primeira vez, patrocínios que o possam ajudar a concretizar o seu sonho de correr pela Europa e quem sabe, ao lado dos melhores pilotos do mundo. Em troca terá todo o gosto de que a marca que apostou nele seja representada nas redes sociais, no jersey, no capacete e na bicicleta, de forma a promover o bom nome das instituições/organizações/empresas que se empenharam no projeto.


O nosso filho é bastante exigente com ele próprio, treina muitas horas, sem perder de vista o sonho de representar o País e levar a bandeira Portuguesa aos melhores pódios mundiais.

Após um ano de prática nas pistas de downhill, é evidente a progressão do Simão, evolução esta que que se deve ao seu forte empenho e dedicação.



O Simão, já realiza saltos de 60cm, demonstra bastante técnica nas descidas e nos trilhos.

O Potencial do Simão é reconhecido como fora de série para a idade, pelos grandes nomes da modalidade.


Está apto a realizar qualquer pista de enduro / downhill em Portugal (adaptada ao seu nível), para tal seguem enumeradas:

BikePark_Serra da Boa Viagem - Figueira da Foz
Caceira Bike Park - Coimbra
Pistas/trilhos de Monsanto - Lisboa
Águeda Bike Park - Aveiro
Aves BikePark - Porto
Pistas de Downhill Canelas - Porto
Pistas da Penha - Guimarães
PumpTrack Ponte de Lima - Viana do Castelo
Jamor Bike Park - Lisboa
Pistas da Meia Perna - Porto
Pistas de Santa Maria Lamas - Aveiro
Pista DH3 - Lousã
Trilhos MakeGreatAgain - Maia - Porto
PedonegroMountainTrails - Ponte de Lima
 
Atentos ao gosto demostrado pela prática do referido desporto e capacidades demostradas, determinamos como prioridade motivar o nosso filho de todas as formas possíveis.

Contactamos a Federação Portuguesa de Ciclismo, mas não aceitaram a inscrição do Simão na modalidade de Downhill, uma vez que esta apenas permite acesso aos praticantes com idade igual ou superior a 11 anos.

Como forma demostrativa das capacidades do anunciado Piloto, salientamos que a Federação Portuguesa de Ciclismo estipula como sendo a altura máxima dos obstáculos equivalente a 50cm em Portugal para crianças com idade de 11 anos, no entanto, o Simão com apenas 7 anos ultrapassa obstáculos com 60cm.



Contudo sabemos que os grandes atletas e campeões vão-se destacando precocemente pela vontade própria, aptidão física, resistência e persistência.

Entendemos como uma absoluta necessidade apoiar, motivar e reforçar as camadas mais jovens, no caso, uma criança, por ser a idade chave, em que adquirem conhecimentos únicos e que em tudo poderá marcar a diferença, quando devidamente apoiada nas vontades próprias e proveitosas.

Ao pretendermos apoiar o nosso filho neste nobre período de sementeira, mais tarde poderão ser colhidos frutos preciosos e proveitosos para a sua vida adulta.



Por se tratar da prática desportiva e de uma aposta no futuro, decidimos continuar a lutar e motivamo-lo a participar em campeonatos nos países vizinhos, onde acreditamos que terá grande sucesso, para correr no escalão dele em busca do TOP 10 mundial.

Além disso, no próximo ano, se a situação do Covid-19 permitir, irá à Megavalanche Alpe D'Huez, ao campeonato de Downhill de Espanha/França representar o nosso País - Portugal.

Tudo isto acarreta avultados custos, desde a necessidade de percorrer quilômetros para o norte e para o sul do país, para conseguir treinar junto de outros adultos em pistas apropriadas e de alto rendimento.

Tomamos a iniciativa de comprar uma bicicleta nova, importada da Alemanha, pois em Portugal não havia a adequada para a idade do Simão, o que representou o investimento de 1900,00 euros.

A Bicicleta que compramos é uma PROPAIN YUMA de roda 24 e suspensão total, a primeira a surgir em Portugal.

https://www.propain-bikes.com/bikes/kids/yuma/

Como forma de divulgar o trabalho do nosso filho, criamos um perfil no Instagram e um canal de Youtube demostrativo do trabalho realizado pelo Simão a par do Pai, onde se podem ver diferentes vídeos e fotos

Assim sendo, perante os objetivos delineados, somos uma família humilde e com racionados recursos financeiros o que nos limita bastante, contudo, por não pretendermos desistir do projeto, tomamos a presente iniciativa, por forma a angariar apoios.

Desejamos o sucesso do Simão Pedro e que ele seja um exemplo a seguir pelas outras crianças/jovens, direcionando-os para à prática desportiva.

Andar de bicicleta é uma atividade desportiva ao ar livre, que fortalece os músculos e desenvolve aprendizagens motoras básicas como equilíbrio, postura corporal e coordenação motora, assim como capacidades cognitivas, emocionais e sociais, há algo melhor para os nossos jovens?


Portugal tem enormes talentos, mas a aposta neles é fundamental para que o nosso País seja evidenciado além-fronteiras e é este o nosso propósito.

O orçamento pedido será utilizado entre:
- Transporte;
- Inscrições;
- Seguros e Exames médicos;
- Alojamentos;
- Manutenção da Bicicleta.

Para qualquer questão não hesitem em entrar em contacto connosco, estamos inteiramente disponíveis para melhor esclarecer/explicar o projeto.

Agradecemos desde já a disponibilidade e consideração demonstrada.

I need 450 people to donate $10 each to support my goal for this campaign is to get to training camp in Juventus.  There are 265 million soccer players in the world, 1.9 million in Australia and more than 10,000 kids aged between five and 17 playing soccer in the state I where I live (ACT).  So as my mum says - do the maths and I should be OK.
My life goal is to be a professional soccer player - but most importantly to play for Australia. Through this campaign I hope to raise enough funds to travel to Juventus and to train and compete at the level necessary to make it all possible.
It is an expensive thing to get from Australia to Italy.  I am doing all I can to raise funds and have been collecting cans (which you can get 10c per piece at recycling centres in Australia) and selling chocolates.  I have made AUD 1000 to kick off this campaign!
I have been working hard and writing letters to members of the soccer community to secure some great items to auction and gift as incentives.  It's been amazing to get support from champions of the game.  I am also offering some fun lego soccer incentives.  Being part of this community has been a great experience and further fuelled my dream to play for Australia and one day give back to kids just like me.
So if you can, make a bid, make a pledge and help me on my way.  I'll keep in touch with you all through out the campaign but also as I head off to Italy in late September (I hope).  Follow my socials and keep me moving forward - all the way to Juventus.

Many of our student athletes come from homes where parents are working long hours, in tough jobs, as they try to make a new life for their children.  With those long work hours, and most of our players working themselves, traditional fundraisers can be incredibly difficult for our team.  We exist as a Title 1, low income school in the heart of Austin, with many of the opportunities afforded to wealthier areas of town, simply not available as viable options to our squad.
Every year, the cost incurred by each player can often hit upwards of $500 after purchasing uniforms, warm ups, bags, cleats, shin guards, and additional gear.  For most of our families, this is not a cost they can take on so we are tasked as a program to try and raise as much as we can to replace our older equipment. A large portion of our money raised will also go towards new practice attire for all of our players so they have the proper clothing and gear for workouts every day.
By contributing, you are giving back to a homegrown, hardworking group of young ladies who strive to improve our program in every way possible.  You will help us to achieve our ongoing goals of making the playoffs and leveling an uneven playing field.
We are asking for your support and to help spread the word! Thank you for anything you can contribute.",1.0,1.0,7.0,11.0,3.0,7.0

We are working on building a new, Aurora based, affordable competitive basketball team. We believe that as a team, we can grow as athletes and as individuals. The process is long, it takes patience, perseverance, and a very dedicated athlete and organization to make it happen. A-CO Royals has fifteen athletes and coaches and support staff working together to get ready for the season. We have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! To help us reach our goals in representing Aurora in competitive basketball local and regional tournaments.
The average cost of a season for a club level athlete in Colorado is $4,000-$10,000 depending on the organization.  
A-CO Royals' goal is to maintain an average of $300 per athlete per season.
Our first financial priority will be ordering uniforms (Under Armor brand reversible jersey, shorts and warm ups) which cost $100 per athlete.  Additional funds raised will go toward equipment and lodging for out of state tournaments.
We aim to keep cost low as possible as many of our athletes will be responsible for covering their own gas expense, tournament and training entry fees.
To keep cost down, our coaches are volunteers, and we practice based on where we can find a gym to accommodate our group.  
By contributing, you are supporting A-CO Royals as an organization and its athletes. You are also becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, that is helping young athletes achieve athletic excellence. Being a part of the A-CO Royals is a big step forward in an athlete's development, and we believe we can take them to the next level.

The cost of event attendance (including event entry, travel, accommodation, etc.) is unfortunately carried by the competitors as Archery in New Zealand does not attract the funding of other high performance sports.

I am 12 years old and I play softball for Ardmore Marist Softball Club. This season I played representative softball for the first time for Counties Under 13 Boys. This has been an incredible season for me, as I have also been selected to represent New Zealand U13 Boys with a tour to America and Canada in July this year. Our team will be playing in a Super 8 International U14 Boys Fastpitch Challenge Tournament.  We will be away for 12 days, starting with a two day camp in LA and then onto Saskatoon in Canada. Here we will have further training camps before we head into the tournament. 
I first started playing softball when I was 9 years old. I play catcher and love this position, requiring fast thinking and reading the game.  Softball has an amazing atmosphere and I really like the hype. Mostly I just love being part of a team and as catcher recognize my key role within this.   This is an outstanding opportunity for me. Undoubtedly a trip of a lifetime. I have never been out of New Zealand so this is just incredible. Traveling to the other side of the world I will meet boys like me who love softball too. I have the opportunity to take my game to another level and feel so proud to represent New Zealand recognizing the honor it beholds. 
My Family and friends are so excited for me and I’m so blessed to have their love and support. My focus now is to fundraise in order to cover costs for this trip. If you feel you could help me with a donation, it would mean a lot to me.

My name is Cristina Casares and I live in Auckland, New Zealand. I am truly passionate about Wind Surfing and Wind Foiling, which I exercise as often as I can. My goal is to race in the New Zealand Wind foiling Nationals in February 2021, and I need your help to make this happen.
I have been windsurfing since I am 15 years old. At 18 years old I was sponsored by CARRERA to race for Argentina and Uruguay, winning races in the women category in Argentina.
Foiling has re-ignited my passion for windsurfing and I have been training for the last year and my goal is to race in the Silver Fleet for New Zealand Windfoiling team.
To excel, I need to be constantly pushing my limits. I am ready to work hard, but at the same time, I know that the road to success will be costly. By supporting me today, you are investing into something bigger than just a fundraiser. You're helping make the impossible possible and making my dream come true!

I was put on skates at 1 and a 1/2 years old since I was always at the rink because of my older sister who picked up the sport 3 years prior. I begun competing nationally at the age of 4, and continued into competing internationally by 12. 
My greatest achievements include; 
12x New Zealand national solo dance champion and 4x Oceania solo dance champion.
At Nationals I have been awarded with the best performance Oscar twice and the same award for under 15's once.
At Oceanias I have been awarded with the Jim Taylor award for best freedance twice.
I am the 2018 junior international solo dance National and Oceania champion.

A huge challenge I've battled with but overcome was, skating for 4 years with painful legs and not knowing the cause of it. After countless visits to different doctors and physios I finally got diagnosed with compartment syndrome in my lower legs. Last year I had to have surgery to release the compartments which caused me to miss out on a year of competing. I bounced back so much stronger in my opinion as I felt like I had to catch up on all the training I had missed and also so excited to finally work towards the competitions I have been dreaming of skating at for years.
My goals for 2019 are competing at America's Cup in Florida and The Roller Games in Barcelona, Spain, as well as Oceania championships in Melbourne, Australia. These competitions are only a few months apart with very high costs. I am funding to raise money for America's Cup as my parents can't afford to cover costs for all my many goals this year.
When I decided to go to this competition, my parents told me that I would have to come up with the money myself. I have borrowed money from them and have been continuously paying them back but I still have a long way to go.
I am currently working part time at a skating rink and I also take Learn to skate / skate classes as well as private lessons.
We have organized two roller discos to help fundraise and I also tried to sell cupcakes at skating events and classes but it didn't really work.
I am endlessly grateful for any contribution or even a share on social media as it's a large cost to cover by myself, so anything would be the hugest help!",14.0,3.0,4.0,19.0,2.0,21.0

Currently, for the class of 2024 in the state of Georgia I am ranked #1 in the 100mh. #3 in the Long Jump, and #3 in the Triple Jump.
As a 100m/300m hurdler, long jumper, and triple jump competitor. I am privately trained by an Olympic hurdle medalist, a small team of high school coaches during the season and am in search of a great jump coach. As an ""unattached"" athlete, my mom carries the cost from race admissions, travel expenses, equipment gear, and is in many ways my coach and body recovery trainer.
This campaign is to assist with my private summer sessions, travel to the Youth Outdoor Championship in New York, NY the end of June and the Junior Olympics in Sacramento, Ca. at the end of July.  
To excel, I need to constantly stretch myself mentally, emotionally, and physically. I also work diligently to stretch myself spiritually believing that all things come from God (good, bad, or indifferent). I am ready to work hard, but at the same time, I know that the road to success will be costly; so, there is also a financial ""stretching"" required for my success. By supporting me today, you are investing into something bigger than just a fundraiser. You are changing my life that will impact the lives of many other black and brown girls who wake up every day with the willingness to sound their voices and make their marks in the world!  
So, on your mark...
Get Ready...
Set...
Go...

My name is Seaver King and I am from Athens, GA and I attend Athens Christian School where I am a senior. I started playing baseball when I was 4 years old and I am hoping to get the opportunity to play in college. Covid restrictions cut my spring season in half and limited college coaches from being able to see me play over the summer. 
I have been given an opportunity to play with my organizations national team this fall. Division 2 colleges are now permitted to watch me play and the division 1 schools will be provided with video of my games. This is my first opportunity to play on a national setting and my family and I are very excited. This will also be a very expensive six week experience. 
I will be in 4 different states and playing 5 times from September 12 - October 12. These will be the most competitive and exclusive events I have ever competed in. 
My family and I need your help to cover our travel expenses and entry fees for playing these events. Our estimated costs for this opportunity is $5000. We are seeking help to raise half of those funds here. 
Thank you, in advance, for your contributions, warm wishes, and prayers. ",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,8.0

The Jockey club Hockey from Paraguay isn't looking for help to win a medal, we are looking for your support to help us build our own hockey pitch. Yes, It may sound crazy, but being a hockey player in Paraguay is. In Paraguay the main sport is Soccer, so others sports are unattended, specially Field Hockey. We only have ONE official hockey pitch un the country for all the clubs and the Paraguay team to train and play.
Jockey club Hockey is a small club, but in less than a year we've managed to open 3 leagues for the local championship, starting with the kids, 8 to 14 years old, and two teams competing in the major leagues. All of our club expenses (pitches rent, coaches salary, uniforms) are covered by players, working untiringly through the year. And even with all of this against us, we've managed to win the 2017 championship in two of our leagues.

Join us in our journey to the Orange Bowl International Youth Regatta in Miami, Florida where there will be 700 boats from 20 different countries! Over the past year, we have been working extremely hard and participating in our regional High School Sailing Circuit. We have decided that we are ready to try to compete at a higher level. This regatta will be our first endeavor into the world of Junior Olympic Sailing, which we hope to pursue. However, as we advance through the levels into these larger competitions, expenses are greater and it becomes more difficult to support ourselves to pursue our passion. This regatta itself is costing us more than any other regatta we have participated in before. We would love to be able to have the chance to attend this regatta to help us know where we stand, gain a sense of the competition, and learn how we can continue to improve in order to be successful moving forward. Help us follow our dreams of competing at a higher level and be a part of our journey as we head to Miami for our inaugural regatta in this circuit!

Where there is disparity, there is opportunity. FC Barcroft is a soccer club in Arlington, Virginia seeking to rewrite the narrative of career player development in US Soccer. More specifically, FC Barcroft is seeking to eliminate barriers to entry for talented low-income and underprivileged young adults in the Greater Washington Area to play the beautiful game of soccer at a semi-professional level. Currently, the game is losing increasing numbers of talented young players to US Soccer’s Pay-to-Play business model, which is exclusionary in nature. With a relatively small number of players being recruited to play professionally in the US, many top-class players are forced to give up on their dreams when asked to pay hundreds of dollars to participate for a single season with a local club. FC Barcroft is actively seeking to upend this model and sponsor talent of all kind in the Northern Virginia community, not just the privileged. Having experienced a 35% rise in population in the last half-decade that is overwhelmingly due to international migration, the Greater Washington Area, a true microcosm of the world, is a quintessential environment for FC Barcroft to operate. With the leadership in place, FC Barcroft is uniquely qualified to execute on its mission of becoming a successful team competing in UPSL – Division I over the next two years. All at no cost to the players.

What's Next for Us
We have been admitted into the UPSL - Northeast Conference - Beltway Premier Division for the upcoming Spring 2021 season. The season is set to begin on April 15th and run through June 15th roughly. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for our boys and a platform that many of them have never had. The level of excitement and commitment emanating within the team for this new challenge has been unbelievably encouraging. Many of our boys have the goal (and ability) to go on and play at the professional level, and this season will be a monumental step towards the realization of their dreams.

Where You Come Into Play

Whether you are a player, fan, volunteer, individual donor, nonprofit organization, or local business, we would love the opportunity to connect with you. We want to build community and forge relationships every step of the way. A distinguishing feature of this team (set up as a nonprofit) is our players pledge to give back to the community.

A questo link trovate una breve presentazione della Arese GTV:

Come ben immaginerete, fondare e avviare una squadra richiede parecchio tempo e soprattutto denaro, in particolar modo una squadra di running, sport ""povero"" per antonomasia.
Noi ce la stiamo mettendo tutta e tutto quello a nostra disposizione è andato nelle prime spese societarie... ora però, abbiamo bisogno di voi per i successivi step, che consistono in:
Acquisto della divisa societaria (guardala nella presentazione e dicci se vi piace!)
Affiliazione Federazione Sportiva FIDAL
Avvio campagne marketing
 Se deciderete di aiutarci, avrete contribuito a ridare alla comunità di Arese una sua squadra di running, seria, competitiva e professionale, che possa rappresentarla a testa alta durante gli eventi e le competizioni ufficiali... e il vostro nome, se lo desiderate, comparirà sul nostro sito, nell'albo dei ""tipi giusti"", ovvero i privati che hanno permesso la realizzazione di questo progetto!

We are A.S.D Arese GTV running team, a no profit sport club representing the city of Arese (MI).
Arese is a cozy village near to Milan city center, which became famous thanks to historic brand Alfa Romeo who, in the late 1960s, decided to move their head quarter there.
Finally, after years, our city will have his running team back.
At the following link you may find a short presentation of ARESE GTV:
https://my.flipbookpdf.net/HvUOG 
As you can image, founding and setting up a new sport club is taking long time and specially lots of money considering that in Italy running is considered a “poor sport”.
We’re doing our best and we covered by ourself all the initial expensis for the social media and the burocracy…then now we really need your support for the next steps:
Purchase of the club uniform (swipe into the presentation and tell us if you like it!)
Affiliating to FIDAL (Italian Athletics Federation)
Startup of the marketing campaign
If you will support us with a donation, your name will be shown on the “COOL GUYS” wall on our website, the list of all the people who helped us to realize this project.

I really thought that was the right thing to do as I am lucky being able to walk, run and eventually participate the Marathon.

I grew up playing youth football, and then high school. I have coached youth football for the Manassas Sharks in Manassas, VA. I recently relocated to Medellin, Colombia and I am volunteering as a coach for an American Football team in the neighboring city of Envigado. The  team consists of 30 Colomians that have seen and love American football. Very few have had any experience playing until joining the team. Previously, they have not had someone take on the role of a coach. Instead relying on one player that had experience playing in  the USA, that plays both offense and defense and calls all plays, runs practices, etc. When I met with the team the first time, I was accepted with open arms  and have been treated like family since.

The team plays in the Federacion Colombiana de Futbol Americano which is a member of International Ferderation of American Football. The league consists of 9 teams throughout Colombia. In 2015 the Envigado football team advanced  to the semi-finals. We are preparing and looking to go further in 2016.
Unfortunately, I was recently informed that the founder of the team no longer has interest in continuing operations, leaving 30 guys that have been working hard to prepare for the season without a team.

We are raising money to legally register the team and continue operations. In addition we will need to replace the equipment lost in the process, and help those that want to play but are having trouble obtaining the equipment needed. The monthly minimum wage is less than $300 here, the cost of a helmet alone can exceed this amount. In the past, guys have practiced without helmets and without football pants with the proper pads. I admire the passion, but we have all heard the talk of concussions and the possible effects. I simply will not allow someone to participate without the proper gear. We have also made a commitment to the Mayor of Envigado to create a girl's flag football team.  The funds will help us keep that commitment.
We will need to purchase 30-40 jerseys at a cost of $2000. An additional 12 helmets for $2500. The additional donations will cover filing fees, training equipment, and gear for the women's program. Please help if you can or share with your friends.",9.0,2.0,6.0,22.0,6.0,24.0

 It was a beautiful day and for Bas it was the daily ride on his motorcycle from work back to his home. No one could have imagined that it would be his last motorcycle ride ever. Certainly not Bas! 
 That evening his parents were waiting for him to come home for dinner, but Bas didn’t come. He should have been home already. “Where was he?” his mother kept asking.
On his way home from work, after a 40-mile ride on his motorcycle and just one mile from his house, Bas was involved in an accident. A huge traffic jam, closed roads, medical helicopter, police and firefighters. All the emergency services were on the scene and Bas was rushed to the hospital.  
A broken wrist, four broken ribs and a broken spine. He was paralyzed from the chest down. Bas realized all too well that he would never walk again. Later that evening he was reunited with his parents in the hospital. Everyone was happy to see each other, even in these circumstances. 
Fortunately, after a long rehabilitation period, nothing happened to his enthusiasm. The only thing that had changed, really, was that his motorcycle had been exchanged for a wheelchair. 
Can you imagine in an instant no longer being able to move your legs?
Bas is a go-getter and very positive. Nothing will hold him back. In addition to teaching full-time at the local police academy, he is active in three sports: swimming, hand cycling and wheelchair racing. Combine these and you get a triathlon! Would one sport not be enough? No, not for Bas! He wants to show what you can achieve with a strong mind and a strong physical body. Even arm-powered!
Goal-setting has worked for Bas throughout his life, especially during rehabilitation. Now he has set another big goal. Bas wants to compete in the Ironman 2020 World Championships triathlon in Kona, Hawaii and Taupo, New-Zealand! For any athlete this would be a monumental challenge, but for Bas, being arm-powered, it will be an even bigger one! 
But in order to participate in both events, Bas must first qualify. That now has priority!
We want to ensure that Bas can achieve his goals. While busy with an intensive training schedule, he also has to consider the enormous costs that are involved, including airline tickets, accommodation, entry fees, handlers, transporting his hand cycle and racing wheelchair, and more. 
We would like to raise money so that Bas can take part in one of the three upcoming qualification events. Would you like to help Bas reach his goals? It will be wonderful if you choose to make a donation!

I am working on several business concepts that focus on my favorite things! I am excited to announce that I am hosting my first Basketball Camp this summer when I return home from Egypt! And of course, it will be UNIQUE under my business venture, F.A.B. (Female Athletes Beyond)!  

F.A.B. is a community that helps and uplifts all female athletes by providing life skills and resources beyond their sports. The Basketball Camp will provide an empowering retreat where young girls are provided sports and life mentorship through drills and skills training!

My goal is to host 75 Girls at Camp - Elementary and Middle School Student Athletes. I'm raising funds for Lunch, Snacks, Camp Shirts, Camp Swag, Basketballs, Workshop Curriculum Materials, Hygiene Items, Waiver/Insurances and several other items.

Why I need your support?
If you know me, you know my love for basketball, the color pink - just to name a few. As I have been involved in sports for several years, I feel it is important to have a life balance and always try to chase your dreams! The basketball camp will also include workshops focused on Etiquette, Game-Day Routine and Social Media. I am excited to host my first annual camp in support of young Girls by being a resource to sports and life mentorship.

In return you are inspiring a community of young student athletes who will help empower our future.

My name is Haraldur Ingólfsson, nickname Halli, and I am truly passionate about women's soccer in my hometown in Iceland. 
This is my effort to raise funds for two related Icelandic women‘s football (soccer) teams located in Akureyri, a town of 18,000 people in the northern part of Iceland. “Thor/KA” (Þór/KA) is a premier league team and “Hamrarnir” play in League 2.

Thor/KA have won the Icelandic championship twice, 2012 and 2017, among other smaller competitions. The mutual U19 team, “Thor/KA/Hamrarnir” are current champions of Iceland.

Every year, the players, their parents and families, and other supporters work hard to raise funds to cover costs, such as for travel, equipment, coaches etc. They take various jobs, sell all kinds of stuff etc. It is a lot of work for everyone. A while ago the girls started selling „Smart Socks“ (smartsocks.is) as a part of fund raising effort by the club to help run the teams.

When the sock sale started in February, I wanted to inspire them to sell more and promised (first as a joke, but it became serious very quick) to run 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) for every pair of socks they sold before March 15th. They sold 310 pairs, so during the month of April I will run the total distance of 310 km (~193 miles). The goal is to finish this within the month.

Challenge starts on April 1. Starting on April fool’s day is not a coincidence. I will probably look like a fool running. But I do it with happiness in my heart, because it is for my teams.

So, if you want, you can donate a certain amount or decide a certain amount for each kilometre I finish and see what that will amount to.

I will be posting videos and photos on social media:

I created this campaign to assist in allowing us to attend the tournaments for our 2014/2015 indoor season.

When we attend out of town tournaments we play against other clubs that we typically do not see in our own association, this allows the players to see different styles of play and work towards competing at the highest levels.

Your support is greatly apprectiated.
I will be using the funds for:
Covering tournament registration fees, team meals at tournaments and renting rooms to host team events while at tournaments. At the moment we are registered for two tournaments this season, one in Lethbridge and one in Edmonton. If we play well enough throughout the season then we will also attend the year end provincials tournament which this crowdfunding would also be used for at that time.
Your contribution means:
That the girls can have a great experience competing in these tournaments. Playing in these tournaments allows the girls to face off against other clubs that we do not see within our Soccer Association. The experiences they have at these tournaments allows them to become better soccer players and reach their goals of competing at the highest level possible.",,,3.0,4.0,0.0,10.0

One of these initiatives was to hold the Dubai Intercontinental Cup U13 Ghana Edition, which was a qualifying tournament for the global edition which takes place in Dubai from February 22-24. Lizzy Sports Academy, winners of the Ghana qualifying event, are the team to represent Ghana on the world stage in Dubai. They will be competing against world class clubs such as AC Milan, FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, Liverpool and Juventus and are ready to prove their worth against them. We have created a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds to get the team their flight tickets to Dubai to take part in the tournament.
For the Ghana event, Real Madrid legend Michel Salgado's team, who will be the hosts of the Dubai tournament, were brought in as a guest team to take part. Michel Salgado was so impressed by what he saw that he chose not less than 7 Ghanaian players from the tournament who he would recommend to clubs around Europe. The Ghana event was also endorsed by another former Real Madrid legend, Roberto Carlos.
This crowdfunding campaign has become necessary because it has been difficult to get corporate partners in Ghana. Sports marketing in Ghana is quite difficult and will take some time for companies to fully understand its power. Most of what has been done so far has been out-of-pocket. Nonetheless, we need help to get Lizzy Sports Academy to Dubai. Luckily, their kits are being taken care of by Lika Sports from Canada, and their accommodation and transportation arrangements have been sorted out as well. The next big expense that we need help with is tickets for 12 players, 2 coaches and 2 support staff and a camera man to document the whole experience.

So, when we have found the club of Modern Sword Fighting ""Ensifer"", last year, it was like a flash, changed our life.
At the monet in the club there are 6-8 fighters and they are the fans of this sport also. Boys from 6 to 13 years old train despite any difficulties: weather, school, ilness - nothing can stop them to come to the training.
9-11 March 2018 our club took a part in Europe Championship in Minsk, Belarus. 18 countries has fight for the medals, and Moldavian team took third place. Total fighters from ""Ensifer"" club took 4 medals.
This is a really good result, and we have to not stop the practice of taking part in international Tournaments. That's why our goal at the moment is Marchidial Tournament, which is planned at 9-10 June 2018 in Champeix, France.
Our team needs 2700 Euro for transport and some organizational expenses.

We are working to get childrens from streets, to make them confident and to give them good start in sports and our life . The process is long, it takes patience, perseverance, and a very dedicated athlete and organization to make it happen. At now Mixfight.ZT has 35 athletes and 1 coache working together to realise our goal. We have created a fundraising campaign and we want to team up with you! To help us reach our goals to give a chance on the world stage, fight for medals on the international circuit, and have the means to do so.

During the short 4 years of the club’s existence, our athletes became numerous winners of international and national MMA championships. Unfortunately, being a non-profit organization, our team is in dire need of its own gym. At the moment, the rental period of the commercial gym is ending, and our children may lose the opportunity to train and get a chance for a sports career.

The average cost of organizing a gym that can accommodate up to 60 athletes is $ 50,000. This includes the repair of the premises, the purchase of necessary equipment and sportswear for performances at national championships. Part of the amount needed for the organization of the gym provides us with local government and sponsors.

By contributing, you are supporting Mixfight.ZT as an organization and its athletes, but you support not only the club itself, but also the very idea of working with children, giving them a chance to achieve more in this life. You are also becoming part of something BIG, and so POWERFUL, that is helping young athletes reach their dreams and achieve athletic excellence. Being a part of the Mixfight.ZT is a big step forward in an athlete's development, and we believe we can take them to the next level.

My name is Maya and I am a fitness bikini athlete from Ukraine.
I am a beginner in bodybuilding. I started competing last year and fell in love with the stage.
This love was mutual which can be seen from my results: I placed 2nd in the NPC contest in Poland and 3rd in WABBA world championship in Italy. I thought that was a good start, so I was getting ready for new achievements, new contests and new positive emotions. But the war had crossed all my plans and turned me into a refugee. I and my boyfriend Andrew were going to compete together this spring. He is not only my soul mate but also the world champion and my trainer. I owe my achievements to him. We were ready for the first champ: all was already prepaid, even the makeup and tanning was arranged.

But suddenly the nightmare happened. On the 24th of March the Russian rockets suddenly hit my city. I was the only one in the family who escaped the country. Andrew and my parents had to stay.
Right now I am in Norway where my good friends gave me a place to stay and work. I am trying to help my family from here. I am very thankful to all people who support Ukraine. You help us fight the absolute evil.
Of course, life means more than anything else. I am safe here, that’s the main thing, but all this time since I arrived to Oslo I’ve been thinking about the missed competition season.
But last week I felt hope. While surfing the net, I came across an advertisement for the bodybuilding championship - Complete Strength Classic 2022. It’s going to be held here, in Oslo, on the 23rd of April. My heart skipped a beat. I realised how much I want to participate. Andrew says we have enough time to prepare.
So, I am here now, asking for your help. Help me get on stage and raise the Ukrainian flag there. The money that I aim to gather should be enough to cover my preparatory expenses and participation fees. I think I have a pretty good chance to win. If I win I promise to donate the prize money to the Ukrainian army.
My dear friends! You are just one click away from doing the justice and making my dream come true. Let’s do the right things together. Let’s let’s fight evil in any possible way, let’s get on stage and make this world a much more beautiful and safe place.  
I wish you all peace! You can’t imagine what a treasure it is - to be able to hold the ones you love. Share a bit of your love with me and it returns back!

I am the founder of the sports club ""Hawks"" in Belaya Tserkov, Ukraine.
The goal of the club was to introduce an exotic sport in his native city.
20,10,2015 I created a children's team in American football (flag football). In the first year, children under my leadership became vice-champions of the country.

In April 2016 I created an adult team for American football. And in the season of 2017 we take the second place in the national championship in Division C.

The situation in our country is not stable, and sport is very expensive. A lot of guys want to engage in this sport, but their parents are not in a position to allow it. How many talented young people. Hundreds of people. And because of a lack of finance, they can not afford such an opportunity.
The minimum salary in our country is 3200UAH - $ 118, when the price for a set of equipment is $ 300-500. Not everyone can spend such money on a hobby.
Children's uniform is a little cheaper, but still. For most families, this is not realistic.
At the beginning of the way of creating the club, as its founder, I spent a huge amount of money on the purchase of 20 sets of equipment. And in Ukraine it's a lot of money for a guy who was 22 years old. But i had a dream - at my city must be American football team.
What we do in our city and the region, people find very interesting. Many fans come to look at the adult team. But always the same question. Why are there so few people in the team? We reply that not everyone can afford this sport.


My task and my organization is to attract more people to sports. American football. Make it so that this sport would be available.
After calculating the amount of necessary finance for the purchase of inventory, we determined that we need support. Otherwise, this sport will be just an illusion on our territory.
I understand quipment its first step for result and we have a lot of work.
All who will be able to help us raise funds, I will be very grateful, because we primarily want our children and children of our city to have the opportunity to play sports.
Thank you for attention.
Sincerely, Zorin Alexey.",5.0,0.0,5.0,9.0,1.0,10.0

Good day, everybody, who decided to lose a bit of own time and for your interest to Sevastopol Rugby team. Every donation is greatly appreciated and will go towards for our development with participation in competitions.
 I kindly want to tell you our story. Our city, Sevastopol, located in the Crimea – Former part of Ukraine, annexed by Russia.  During first “Russian” year sport programs in Crimea receive big donations from Government. But now only 1 team (Team of State University) receives equipment and free stadium for using, also free shuttle bus for out-Sevastopol games. And our old team barely exists without help, good coach and normal conditions for training. Therefore some team-mates decided to make absolutely new rugby team – “Crimean Pirates” independent of Government and Universities. You can visit our page in East-European social network - https://vk.com/sevsu_rugby .We don`t have any sponsor`s and donators help. We try just develop rugby in our region, to give a chance for people, who can`t pay for training – to have a free training and to play and win with our team.
Last year our team became a city champion of Beach Rugby and received invitations for Russia-wide Beach Games 2015 in Sochi. But unfortunately we were not able to go there due to lack of money.
 This year we want to participate at least on All-Crimea competitions with your help, support and donations. Situation is following. We don`t have good equipment for training. We pay own money for loan of very bad training field. Also we want to order good team uniform. And of course we need money for transfer for out-Sevastopol games, because season just beginning.
We calculated costs, which we need for season and it equated 5000 USD and additionally 3000 USD for participation in next Beach Rugby Championship.

Our team consists of 11 female and 11 male athletes from around the world. We are a self-funded and self-managed team. We play tennis all year long, train hard and compete against the best varsity teams in Canada, and occasionally the US. But perhaps most importantly, we are a family and we share some of the most memorable college memories, both on and off the court. 

Here is a bit of our recent history, and a short explanation on why we need your help:

Because of new budget cuts, McGill had to revoke the team's varsity status in 2010. A new self managed and self funded competitive club was created in order to provide McGill with a platform for talented and passionate tennis players. The team was created co-ed in order for McGill to participate in the National University tennis tournament held at the Roger's cup.

After a #1 seed finish during the fall season, for the first time McGill tennis qualified for the National tournament!!

However, we have to depend on our own winnings and the money we raise in order to participate. Since the tournament is held in Toronto this year, we need to cover travel and hotel costs as well as competition fees.

Please help McGill tennis 2013 reach it's goal to be the first ever tennis team at McGill to win a national title. Not only will the efforts of all its current members be well rewarded, but also efforts of past members who helped start up the team, manage and support it for the past years throughout a difficult change.
Most importantly..
The chance to participate during the Roger's cup for a National tournament could give the tennis team the extra visibility it needs to ensure a tennis future at McGill. 

If you cannot contribute to our cause, here are some other ways you can help:

I've played multiple other sports and have finally found the one that fits my personality and physical abilities.... rugby. As a first year player I am ecstatic to have been selected to play at the national level for team Alberta. I take my athletics very seriously and put 100% into everything I do. In addition to Team Alberta I also play for  the Calgary Jr. Rams and the Zone 2 Team for Alberta Summer Games. This leads to me to practicing five days a week on average and on the other two days I am either doing cardiovascular or weight training. I firmly believe that victory doesn't just happen on the field during games... It is earned with sweat in the off-season and effort during practices.

Noticing our potential, many wrestlers who were not satisfied with the methodology of training in other clubs, began working with us and they quickly gained the skill necessary to become champions. Couple of examples: Dorothy Yeats won the 2013 World Junior Championship, Angus Cowell became Canadian Cadet Champion and 2nd USA cadet championship. In 2014, we believe that they will continue to win and others such as John Yeats will join them. John who is 16 years old, has the potential to become a champion of Canadian youths. We have big plans for 2014. Our wrestlers have to participate in the Canadian championships, Pan American and world competition. For enhanced training, they also need to go to training camp. All these activities are expensive. Beyond that, we urgently need to buy wrestling mat and other training equipment. 

We are grateful for the financial assistance of all sports fans. In turn, we are ready to respond to your requests: send autographed photos, videos, arrange a meeting with a demonstration of medals and wrestling techniques and hold a free lesson. 

In addition, during our work we found that Canadian coaches had bad methodical preparation and lacked knowledge of psychological preparation. This lack of fundamental knowledge can be obtained only after finishing a full course of university.  Therefore, we offer all the high-level athletes (Canadian Champion and above) in all kind of sports where the work is carried out in an anaerobic ( oxygen-free ) mode (all kinds of wrestling , boxing, MMA , judo ) to take part in the training camp organized by our Academy twice a year in Colorado Springs -based U.S. Olympic training . Training in high altitude increases the functionality of the body and the effect last up to 6 months. Trenerovok is a technique developed by Soviet scientists for the preparation of national teams for the Olympic Games. The first camp we organized was in December 2013 to prepare for the national championships. To increase the functionality of the preparation for the World Cup, we will hold meetings in June and July 2014 .

Thank you for supporting the next generation of wrestlers in Quebec & Canada!",14.0,1.0,7.0,20.0,3.0,22.0

 “What is the Gaucho Derby?” 
The Gaucho Derby is a 10-day, 500 km, multi-horse, adventure race through Patagonia. The race is touted to be one of the greatest tests of horsemanship and survival skills on Earth, and is by invitation only. More information can be found here: Gaucho Derby. After an extensive application and interview process, I have been offered a spot in 2021 Derby! This is a huge honor and I am excited to spend the next year training physically and preparing mentally for this challenge.
I am driven to participate in this race for two reasons. The first is to support the Family Access Network (FAN), a Central Oregon based non-profit that works to support children in innovative and persistent ways. FAN's mission is to connect children and families to resources that keep the kids healthy, fed, and successful in school. My goal is to use the race as a pledge drive to support 100 children in 2021, which is equal to $10,000. 
For the past three years I have been intimately involved with the Boys and Girls Club and Big Brothers Big Sisters. I have seen first hand the impact direct advocacy and availability for children has on the rest of their lives. You can find out more here about Family Access Network: FAN Story. The truth is, my siblings and I were supported by organizations like this and I feel it's time for me to give back. I plan to give 5 hours a month and 3% of my income to FAN and other non-profits like it over the next year.
The other reason I am driven to do this extraordinary race is that it combines all the things that have helped me overcome adversity in my life. Those things are: horses, persistence, resourcefulness, adventure, knowledge and passion. To have all the things that feed my soul and make me feel alive combined in one final test makes this a crowning achievement. I plan to do this race for myself and for all the things I believe in!
The race is expensive and I can not afford to do it without some help. The race fee covers: 13 veterinarians, 200 leased horses, a state of the art medical team, satellite tracking, three days of training, 15 checkpoint stations, and all the infrastructure needed to run a race of this size and scope.
In return for your support:
I will be able to raise money for an amazing organization (FAN)
Give you exclusive access to track me in the race
Provide regular training updates
Pledge five volunteer hours a month, plus 3% of my income to children advocacy non-profits
Offer you a unique opportunity to be intimately involved in a once in a lifetime adventure!

in Sydney which is owned by two brothers in their 20's. The gym has existed for around 4 years now and during that time has seen many world champions teach and train at our facility and our own athletes have gone on to fight in Combat on the biggest stages in the world representing 'Martial Arts Development' and Australia.
We would like to make being a professional athlete easier for our team, and we need your help! You could be the reason some of these guys will become champions :)

One of our athletes Thanh 'Aladdin' Vu is competing again in ONEFC in Singapore this month on the 30th. This is a huge event and is broadcast to Millions throughout Asia and the world. Thanh has a tough fight and is one of the main card fights. He will be competing against the Number 1 and most popular MMA fighter in China, Ji Xian. He has had to pay for many costs out of his own pocket including medical specialist tests to compete and other basic costs of being a professional athlete.

We have some other impressive athletes that train at Team M.A.D who also will need assistance in the future. (Active athletes):
-Thanh 'Aladdin' Vu- ONEFC (Second largest MMA show in the world)
-Ali Araki- 2 x Iranian National Wrestling Champion competing Sambo and MMA
-David Sekharia- 18 year old upcoming MMA prospect
-Carissa Holland- Australian representative in Freestyle Wrestling.
-David Taylor-Smith- Professional MMA fighter and Competed World Sambo Championships for Australia in 2013.
-Glenn Taylor-Smith- Former TUFFA Australian Title holder, professional MMA fighter.

We cannot rely on funding from Businesses so we have come to you guys or maybe you might be able to suggest businesses to take a look at our increasing stable of future champions!

We are creating a fund for the next year which will help our athletes cover the cost of medical tests before competition (eg- specialists, physiotherapists, etc) and specialised training and equipment (sports conditioning scientists, etc). To reach the top our athletes must look after themselves and use the best services around.

Martial Arts Development funds most activities, coaching, equipment and tries to assist our athletes in anyway. However, when an athlete is required to have eye exams from a specialist before competition,or has a niggling injury that needs immediate treatment, this can put a dent in an athletes bank account and spirit.

Our aim through your help is to provide a bank account for 2014 so that if the competition team needs something special that will assist their growth and future, We can provide it to them or assist financially.

We are a strong team that reinvests into each of our members. 

If you can help us out with any small donations, we would be extremely grateful. Even if you cant afford, we would be appreciative if you could share this to the world! Tell the world how a small local gym in Sydney has some amazing athletes that need some help and a team that is doing what it takes to get them to the top! :)

Thank you for taking the time to read our cause!

Från att ha varit i princip obefintlig finns nu ca 50 barn och ungdomar som spelar fotboll.
Roligt så klart, men inte utan utmaningar för en mindre förening. 
En nystart som vi står inför nu är förknippat med många kostnader och vi vill samtidigt hålla avgifterna nere för att alla ska kunna vara med. En ekvation som vi lyckats lösa till stora delar, men en sak vill vi be er om hjälp om.
För att hjälpa oss att skapa en gemenskap, ett lag, vill vi satsa på att köpa träningsoveraller. Föreningen kommer stå för en del av kostnaden, men egenkostnaden skulle fortfarande bli lite för hög för att vi tror att alla ska kunna ha råd, runt 500:- i dagsläget. 
Genom denna typ av Crowdfunding vill vi be er som känner att det finns möjlighet att ge en extra slant till ert barns verksamhet eller betala de 500:-/overall som skiljer nu för att sänka priset totalt sett för alla.
Tryck på den gröna knappen ""contribute"" och välj hur mycket du vill bidra med. Tänk på att beloppet anges i Euro här. I skrivande stund är 1 Euro=10,60:-
Välj sedan ""one-time contribution"" och om man inte vill ge % av sin donation till plattformen väljer man ""Other"" under tips. Strunta i månadsgåva ""contribute monthly (optional)"" 

Har ni ett företag eller kontakter på ett företag som vill vara med och sponsra, eller rent få tryck på overallen finns det alla möjligheter. Kontakta föreningen för ytterligare info eller välj ""reward"" alternativet här.

Nonetheless, 12.7 million people in Canada did not participate in any fitness-based activity in 2014 (Source: StatCan.gc.ca).
Moreover, in North America, the average membership price for staying fit is USD $42.95 per month, which makes the US and Canada fitness market worth approximately USD $40 billion – USD $50 billion annually (US News 2014).
FitCitie is a universal rewards program for fitness-based activities that aims to accomplish the following:
·        Further motivate individuals to partake in fitness-based activities by offering reward points, known as Sweat Points, which can be redeemed for free/discounted activities, fitness merchandise, etc.
·        Offer a higher return on investments by reducing the average cost per person per activity
·        Create a global affiliate network of fitness providers to increase program accessibility and widen user base for providers
Statistics show that 73% of North Americans have not met their weight loss or fitness goal (Source: US News 2014). By creating a universally accepted rewards program, FitCitie will increase user incentives to meet pre-defined goals by leveraging onto the absence of rewards programs in fitness centers in North America.
Using a 3-phased approach, FitCitie will increase participation in fitness-based activities by awarding Sweat Points by registered activities (Phase 1 - 2016), customized/individualized activities (Phase 2 – 2017) and intensity/frequency of activities (Phase 3 – 2018).
By launching in Montreal, FitCitie will not only capitalize on existing demand for fitness-based activities in the city, but also spread the Montreal fitness culture throughout North America. ",7.0,2.0,3.0,12.0,4.0,14.0

I am currently ranked 2nd in White Belt since competing in Los Angeles in October. My main goals are to continue to strive for greatness.
My journey with Jiu Jitsu has taught me so much about myself, such as my strengths and weaknesses, and how hard I can push myself physically and mentally. I have been to both Regionals and Nationals in Auckland. Maori Nationals In Turangi and the World Champs in America, where I learned so much more about my sport and grew in confidence. To become the best I can be I have to push my limits and develop incredible self-discipline. The thing is, I want more, I know I can do more. I am ready to push my limits even further as I know that I can work my way to GOLD.
To be able to reach these goals this year I have to pay $2500 to get to the World Champs in America again to gain the gold medal that I missed out on this year. This is why I need your support. All donations will directly help me fund my fees. By contributing you will help me reach my goals but you will also take part in our journey of becoming a gold medalist.

My name is Jonathan Gonzalez, and I am requesting your financial support to help me make my pro dreams come true. I never played college, however I was recruited by the Penn State Berks hockey program. I joined the military out of high school and the majority of my hockey experience is playing nearby my duty stations. Don’t be discouraged, I am the man in net. Last June, I was selected to tryout for an ECHL team here in the East, but due to my changing post-military stressors, I had to sell my Pro gear to make rent. This year I don’t want to miss tryout and my roster spot because I don’t have the equipment to showcase my talents. 
I am one of the only goalies in the world able to do a full side split in gear. Many goalies pretend they can by getting low enough, but I have been compared to Jonathan Quick in my abilities and it only makes sense since his Reading Royal teammates used to shoot on me 5am for practice every morning during my summer experience with the Penn State Berks team. 
$4000 will cover all of the cost highest quality equipment which is what I need to make this quick transition from college student to Pro Hockey. ",1.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,5.0

Én most egy több mint 3000 Km-es útra és 26 óra kompozásnyira megyek. Szerinted elég nagy? :D Ha az út magában nem is, de az elköteleződés másfél évre fixen már az. Európa egyik legszelesebb szigetére költözöm, ahol 2024 januárjában lesz kvalifikációs versenyem az Olimpiára. Ez a hely nem más, mint Lanzarote. Pár köztes versenyt leszámítva itt fogok élni és készülni a kvóta megszerzése és az eredményes olimpiai szereplés céljából.
Sokan mondják, hogy nem a cél, hanem az odáig vezető út a lényeg, ezért szeretnélek titeket invitálni és kérni, hogy szálljatok be virtuális autónkba, hogy együtt lejussunk Lanzarotera!

ENGLISH
-Go big or go home- as the English would say. I'm going on a journey of over 3000 Km and 26 hours of ferrying. Do you think big is big enough? :D If the trip itself isn't, the commitment for a year and a half is. I'm moving to one of the windiest islands in Europe, where I'll have an Olympic qualifying race in January 2024. This place is Lanzarote, where, apart from a few intermediate races, I will be living and training with the aim of qualifying and competing in the Olympics.
Many people say that it's not the destination but the journey that counts, so I'd like to invite you all to get in our virtual car and drive down to Lanzarote with me!
